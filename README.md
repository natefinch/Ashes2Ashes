# Ashes 2 Ashes

This is a MUD that ran circa 1999, based on other muds that came and went,
Reality Bytes, Realms of Imagination, etc.  Lots of additions were done by
Sarnoth ([jjsterr](https://github.com/jjsterr), [@jjsterr](https://twitter.com/jjsterr)) to the standard
CircleMUD (multiclassing being one of the biggest).

This MUD was run by various admins over the times, Teddy, Daxx, Booof,
MidKnight/Souljourner (that's me), and a bunch of others that I forget now.

Thanks to Jason 'Opie' Babo ([opiedelivers](https://github.com/opiedelivers),
[@opiedelivers](https://twitter.com/opiedelivers)) for getting me a copy of the
code.

The MUD is currently running at 213.186.62.210:3333, again thanks to opie and
