Meeting Place of the Gods~

place for the gods to meet in relative peace. Besides the occupants and three

ground, no light sources, no boundaries of any kind. Movement is achieved by
pure thought, but being a mere mortal, you cannot comprehend the infinite
reaches of your surroundings and thus can only move to places and objects you

The Abyss~
  A bleak landscape stretches out before you, utterly featureless. The ground
beneath your feet is hard packed dull orange sand. The sky glows a pale pink
from some source beyond the horizon which you can never reach. You see no one
and hear nothing, and an intense feeling of emptiness is driving you closer
and closer to insanity.

A Spiraling Stairway~
  You have to feel your way along the wall here because you cannot see
anything. As you move along suddenly there is no wall beneath your hands
and you stumble forward, but catch yourself as you fall forward onto
another stairway. Once you get your bearings you realize that the spiraling
stairway you have been following has a landing here and there is a steep
stairway leading up where you expected the north wall to be. West are the
stairs you just climbed to get here, however you cannot see to determine
what lies in the other directions. For some reason it is very drafty here,
and this time you can tell it is really wind and not just the touch of a
spirit.

Dalamar's Study~
  This room is quite spacious. There is a window on the far wall, the only
one you have seen in this tower, which provides a good view of most of the
city of Palanthas. There are several plush chairs arranged around a low
table near the left wall. On the right wall is a bookshelf containing
Dalamar's research as well as a few of the rarer magic texts and documents
concerning the structure of the black robes mages. In a glass case next to
the bookshelf are many jars of odd colored liquids, powders, and other
strange or disgusting substances. There is a second, higher table set off
to the right, covered with glass containers and tubing at one end and
stacks of papers and several jars of ink at the other end. On the floor in
the center of the room is a beautifully woven carpet and the walls of the

Upon close examination of the western wall you find an area that doesn't
look right. It is solid to the touch, but as you look at it from different
angles, it looks separate from the rest of the wall, as if it were very far
away. When you try to focus on the far off point where it seems like that
part of the wall is, you catch a glimpse of another room. This could
possibly be a portal to somewhere else.

The Apprentice Quarters~
  This room is a combination warehouse, library, and bedroom. It houses the
apprentice mages and also serves as their place of study. Along the far
wall are several bookshelves filled with all sorts of books on magic, and a
few shelves with jars of different colored powders, plant clippings, and
small animal parts. On the right are beds, bunked three high, and on the
left are large desks set into alcoves in the wall.

  As you continue to climb, you feel a very light brushing of something

  You continue to make your way slowly along the stairway. Although the

made of stone. The center is open, with the lower hall below, but the steps

because of the magic of the grove and the tower. With nothing to block your

The Great Library of Palanthas~
  The biggest library you have every seen stretches out before your eyes.
Rows of books lead to more rows of books and yet more rows of books, on and
on like a forest of knowledge. Acolytes in plain brown robes walk calmly
about in utter silence, taking the books from the tables after people are
done with them and reshelving them. The loudest sound is that of your
footsteps. Straight ahead, past dozens of bookshelves, is a large wooden
door with a likeness of Gilean, god of knowledge, carved into it.

are displayed along side land deeds and small trinkets on top of the

  This is a large square cell. The north west and south walls are made of

along the walls. This place is full of people who have committed some kind
of small crime during the day. A few sit around sadly, but most of them
move all about, jabbering and having a great time. This is because most of

keep an eye on (berate) the prisoners. Most of the building is taken up by

  A narrow street runs along a high stone wall on the north. Although it is
close to the docks, few people wander down here, and the ones that do

A Totally Deserted Alley~
  This is a small alley between the backs of buildings and a high stone
wall to the north. You can just see the top of a dark tower over the wall.
There is no one around and dust covers the street. Even the usual vermin
are strangely absent. At the end of the alley there is an opening in the
wall closed off by a large iron gate. Looking that way sends chills down
your spine and you begin to understand why this place is deserted. Just

unloading cargo, checking inventories, and making and receiving payments.
Groups of people gather on one dock where passenger vessels arrive every
hour. The dock master with the help of several guards watch over all the
activity to make sure that there are no illegal transactions going on, or

Traveling Through the Khalkist Mountains~
  The going is very rough through these mountains. The ground is covered in
loose rocks and very slippery and there are drop offs all over. Most of the
time the easiest path is blocked by boulders and debris, and often the only
choice is clambering up an 80 degree incline. Out of caves and from behind
rocks you think you catch movement and it feels like something is watching
you. Faint sounds echo in the valleys, to indistinct to make out.

In a Forest~
  Trees and brush are thick all around you. There are no signs of civilization
around, and by the size of the trees, this forest must have been undisturbed
for a long time. The sounds of wild animals come from all around, some
pleasant and some violent.

Through a Mountain Pass~
  A little traveled path leads through the mountain pass and down into the
wilderness. The ground is mostly loose rocks and there are many steep slopes.
In some places boulders block the way. The going is rough, but at least it's
better than traveling right over the mountains. As you travel along the sparse
brush gets denser and is then joined by trees.

Tower. In the middle of the mountain pass, just off the road, the tower keeps
watch, protecting the northern lands. The road continues south out of the

down it at the same time. Grooves on each side of the road indicate that is is

there have been in other places, everything was probably vaporized rather
than just burned. In the center of the room, standing out in great contrast

The Blood Sea of Istar~
  Dark storm clouds roll above your head, wind buffets you and it rains on and

has the appearance of blood because of the little amount of light that gets
through the clouds. This is the sea created when the great mountain of fire
fell on Istar ages ago, taking it right off the map. This sea, like the city

A Red Void~
  You fall into the part in the ocean. All around you is a bright red glow
and unbearable heat. After a few moments of falling there is no water
around you anymore. Far below you can see a small patch of land, but it is
moving toward you much slower than you are falling. Eventually the ground
meets you and you find yourself standing on baked, cracked clay. The sky
is bright red, but there is no source of light. As far as you can see in
every direction the ground and sky are featureless and unvarying. A light
breeze blows but it feels like flames on your skin. The air is hard to
breathe and you feel like you might pass out.

sky, just above the ground.

A Glazed Over Beach~
  As you step onto the beach, it crunches beneath your feet. The top of
the sand has been melted and formed a thin layer of natural glass all over
the beach. It is very hot on this island, but still tolerable, certainly
not anywhere near hot enough to melt sand. Looking inland, everything you
can see is devastated by fire.

A Charred Forest~
  It appears that at one time this island was mostly covered by a forest,
but as far as you can see it is all burnt. The ground is spongy with
inches of ash and coals. All the trees are burnt and fallen, making travel
very difficult. Even though there is little shelter and you are still near
the shore, there is virtually no breeze here, and the heat from the sun is
stifling. To the north you can make out a clearing, but the way is blocked
by fallen trees.

A Charred Forest~
  The destruction is just as bad here as it is in the other parts of the
forest, giving no indication as to where the destruction came from. Here
and there small swirls of smoke seep through the ash. Your passing is
clearly visible by the tracks in the ash and haze in the air from soot
thrown up by your passing. Other than your own tracks, there is no sign of
life. The going is very rough, but you can pick a way through to the

An Empty Clearing~
  There is a large clearing in the forest here. A thin layer of ash,
formerly grass, coats the clearing. There is absolutely nothing here, no
tree stumps, no large rocks, no animals or birds. The sun beats straight
down on the black ground, heating the clearing to well above one hundred
degrees. The air is so hot that it distorts you view of the forest just a
few yards away. On all sides of the clearing but the east are charred and
fallen trees. The clearing extends to the east and there appears to have
been some buildings there. The devastation is so great everywhere you can
see that there is still no indication of a source.

A Gutted Village~
  There are rows of foundations scattered about the clearing, but nothing
else remains of the buildings. It looks like this was once a small village
by the layout of the foundations. Near some of the buildings lie charred
fragments recognizable as walls, but there is not enough left of anything
to indicate anything about the people who lived here. As you walk by the
foundations, you notice that most of the stones that made them up are

  It seems as if there was once a wide trail here as the ground is free
from stumps along a path. Many trees have fallen into the path, making

left are burnt fragments of wood. Although shattered and burned, the alter
is in better shape than anything else you have seen on this island, on

Into a Thick Forest~
  The trees here are much closer together than before, and are extremely large.
The undergrowth gets thicker to the point of being almost impassible, but
fortunately this is not a problem as a wide path has been cut out already.

  There is a vallenwood with stairs leading up it here, but that's not
what draws your attention. A large plot of land stretching south and west
is filled with tombstones. There are a surprising number all from the same
year... the year of the last great war when Solace was burned by dragons.
The threat this time is much greater, and what shall become of the world,
no one knows.

Solace~
  This is the entrance to the tree-top town of Solace. There are few buildings
amongst the trunks of the mighty vallenwood trees. Most of the houses and
shops are nestled in the thick branches, high above you. You get dizzy looking
all the way up to the buildings. Around a number of the trees are wide spiral
staircases, allowing access to the upper level.

the tree is a wooden staircase leading into it's branches. The stairs and

lead up to a large building high above. Soft, inviting light shines
through the windows. Near the tree is a big barrel of water, hauled in
from a nearby lake. With the unusually hot summer, the wells have gone dry.

buildings on the ground in the town. During the last great war, when

convenience. Outside is a small pile of coal. Inside the forge colors
everything red.

  Here a small, shrivelled old lady tends a garden near the tree that
holds her home. The garden is small, just enough to provide food for the
lady. The tree is small, at least compared with the other vallenwoods. The
stairs leading up the tree are small also, just enough for one person to
come or go. Everything around here seems to be made for or imitating the
old lady.

A Home in Solace~
  It doesn't look like anyone lives here anymore. The fireplace is cold.
There is a layer of dust on the floor. A chipmunk scurries around in the
kitchen. Branches have grown in the way of the windows so that they let in
almost no light. The house has probably been vacant since the last war,

had a room set aside in case Raistlin, his brother, should turn from his

name stuck when some visiting mages heard the name and left gifts. All
manner of magical gifts have been left here over time, and whether or not
Raistlin's spirit does reside in this room, there are bound to be strange

contrast to the horrible forest guarding the tower, the walkway leading up
to it is peaceful and well kept. White stones form a path to the tower
doors. On either side of the path are trimmed hedges and small patches of
flowers. The tower itself is made of gray stone and has many windows

You cannot tell what wood these doors were made from. They have been

A Room in Waywreth Tower~
  When you enter the tower, you find yourself in a large room with a high
ceiling. The entire room is made of white marble. There are several
benches made of magically formed wood and covered with soft, purple
cushions. Mages of every color, white, red, and black, move about. It
seems that many hallways connect here, although you can only see two. Some
mages come and go by the hallways you can see, but many appear and
disappear when you aren't looking their way. It is very unnerving. A tall,
white-robed mage comes over carrying refreshments. He explains to you that
since the forest let you through to the tower then you must be here for a
reason, so the mages will treat you with respect. But he also warns you
not to wander where you are not invited. On the south wall there is a
small altar dedicated to Solinari.

You cannot tell what wood these doors were made from. They have been
magically shaped. The patterns in the wood seem to tell a story, but for
each person who looks at the doors the story is different. Some say it is
your past, some say it is your future, and some say it is just you mind
running away with you. The mages say it is just a door.

A Library in Waywreth Tower~
  After walking a ways down a hallway you come to a small library. The
room is made of the same stone you saw on the outside of the tower,
however you can't figure out where the marble ended and the stone began.
There are many small tables with high-backed chairs to study at. Long rows
of books extend westward far past where the western wall of the tower
should be. The hallway continues to the southeast, but after what you have
seen here, you wonder if it will come to an end or go on all the way to
the end of the continent.

A Room in Waywreth Tower~
  As you walk down the hallway your surroundings change from white marble
to dark sandstone, although you can't recall just where the change took
place. You end up in what looks like a meeting room. The hallway forms the
western wall of the room and continues on to the southwest. The room
itself is shaped like a big bubble in the hallway jutting out to the east.
The wall is perfectly smooth and you can see no seems in the sandstone.
There is a circular table in the middle of the room with chairs all around
it, all made of dark stained wood. On the east wall there is a small altar
dedicated to Nuitari.

to this room. Once again the substance of the room is different. This time
it is made of large, gray bricks. The room is just a simple square room

A Room in Waywreth Tower~
  The spiraling stairway opens up into this room on the south wall. Right
above where the stairway connects with the wall is a window. Once again
you are baffled that the inside of the tower does not seem to match up
with he physical space outside the tower. The floor of the room you find
yourself in is made of some kind of polished red rock. It shines brightly
where the light from the window hits. The walls are rough stone pained
dull red. On the north wall there is a small altar dedicated to Lunitari.

a small shelf of scrolls and a table and chair in the room. Several mages

A Magically Enhanced Room in Waywreth Tower~
  As you walk into this room you can feel magic all about you. There are
several mages standing in the room, staring intently at something only
they can see. They chant continually while they make subtle hand
movements. The room is perfectly round except for the doorway you entered
from, and a closed door next to it. The door looks like platinum, and the

The Room of The Test~
  This is the room where young magic users come to take The Test. All
magic users must take The Test before they are full fledged mages. It is
forbidden to practice any but the simplest magic if you do not take The
Test and join one of the three orders of mages. No one but those who have
take The Test know what it holds. Those who fail die or are forever
changed. There is someone here right now taking The Test. He is hazy, as if
he is only half here, and he is interacting with something and seems
scared, but the only thing you can see is his shadowy form. The entire
room is so black that you can't tell how far away the walls and ceiling
are, and it looks like you are standing on empty space. The only source of
light is the door, but the light it gives off does not reflect off of
anything.

A Large Chamber in Waywreth Tower~
  On the floor here is an intricate circle made of colored sands. In the
center of the circle is a swirling blue portal in the floor. The air is
very cool, but it is perfectly still. You try to look past the portal, but
it is difficult to see. There seems to be something looking back. Until
now everything in the tower has been clean, but surprisingly there is a
mouse here, on the edge of the portal.

into the floor. There are swirling streaks of blue in the portal, and
every once in a while a flash of multicolored lightning jumps from one

reading from the book and casting some kind of spell. Although the whole

angles, it looks separate from the rest of the wall, as if it were very far
away. When you try to focus on the far off point where it seems like that

The Great Temple of Istar~
  This the largest and most extravagant temple ever known to exist. It is
made entirely of pure white stone, and decorated with gold trim and gems
at every column and doorway. It is a great monument to the gods, but
unfortunately for the people of Istar, it is a greater monument to the
High Priest. He has a statue within, that stands just a hair taller than
the statues of the gods in the courtyard. Even though the gods have a
strong and visible presence in the world, such is the High Priest's
reputation that the population is more in awe of him than the gods.
Everything inside the temple is very expensive and very comfortable.
Velvet cushions cover every chair and bench. The windows are all made of
stained glass and even gems. The rooms are perfumed. The High Priest dines
each night with select guests, and they eat nothing but the best food from
throughout the world off of silver platters.

can't be, Istar was destroyed ages ago in the cataclysm when the gods
punished the people for their arrogance. You must have gone back in time.
It is rumored that such magic is possible, but no one has ever seen it
done before.

On the Streets of Istar~
  A large market is set up here. Farmers from miles away have come to sell
their products. Each guild in the city has it's own booth to display their
wares. Even the High Priest has a booth where members of the clergy sell
holy water and small emblems of the various gods.

The Catacombs Below Istar~
  Connected to the sewer system of Istar is a series of rooms connected by
tunnels. It is very dark and very isolated. Here the great wizard,
Fistandantilus lives and performs experiments. Until Raistlin, he was the
most powerful wizard ever to exist. Raistlin was able to gain as much
power as he did because he absorbed some of Fistandantilus' soul to
survive his Test.

Collision with a Mountain of Fire~
  You try to escape, but you cannot run fast enough to get away from the
punishment the gods have delivered to Istar. Amazingly you are not crushed
or burned to death. At the last moment you are swept out of the world.
However quickly realize you have been chosen for an even worse punishment
as you find yourself falling into the Abyss.

clouds move rapidly along horizon and occasionally tendrils reach out and pass

A Strange Beach~
  The beach ends here, with a tall cliff to the north. The shape of the beach
and the steep rock cliffs give it an unnatural appearance, as if someone very
powerful carved it out of the rock. That and the absence of any life make you
wonder if you should really be here, but you're already here so why not
explore, right?

A Strange Beach~
  The sand here is very fine and pure white. Holding it in your hand it looks
just like ground glass. The beach looks like it has not been disturbed in
years, there is not a single irregularity in the surface of the sand except
for where you step. You also cannot find any sign of life, not birds, no
plants, no insects. On the east is a sheer cliff, while a much gentler rock
slope leads up and away from the beach to the south. To the north is more
beach, and on the west huge waves roll in and claw their way far up the beach
as if reaching for you.

A Rocky Slope~
  A steep rock face leads down to a small beach enclosed by cliffs. You can
hear the sounds of the water washing over rocks below you, but oddly you hear
no calls from the birds that you would expect near a body of water. There is
no plant life here either as the ground all around you is rock.

A Long Trip With a Short Stop~
  As you stumble around in the darkness at the top of the stairs, you take
a step to find no ground beneath your foot. You try to keep your balance
but can't and fall out into the darkness. After a second it grows bright as
you fall through the cloak of darkness at the top. Although it is little
comfort, you realize for a brief second that you are drifting sideways and
will hit the stairs on the side rather than falling all the way to the
bottom, and then you smash into the stairs, bones breaking wherever you hit
the sharp stone edge of a stair. Fortunately the pain lasts only a split
second as you lose consciousness when your head hits.

In Chaos' Presence~
  The heat here blisters your skin. There is a rush of air like a blast
furnace that deafens you. It is hard to see because looking anywhere but
down is so bright it's like looking at the sun. The air tastes like iron
and smells like brimstone.
