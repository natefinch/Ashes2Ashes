Outside a guard station~

You have come across a small guard station at a bend in the path.  There is
a small booth right off the path to the west, and an armed guard is standing
in the center of the path before you.  You are free to go back the way you

As you begin walking down the path you hear a curious sound coming from
behind you.  You turn to see what is making the noise, and watch as your 
footsteps slowly disappear, erased by a hot desert wind which pushes the
immense dunes before it.  It appears you can't go back the way you came,
so you push onwards to the north, and towards the strange metal structure
ahead.

large docking bays is located.  The wall of the building on the east

the city from the blasts of leaving spacecraft.  From a domed building

little building is the entrance to the underground Cantina.  Orleon
Lane runs north and south here.

merchants use this bay because of the excellent security that the Imperial
bay down the street lends to the surrounding areas.  Many different types
of merchant vessels have been left here while their captains are out

Inside the Cantina~

You can see that the Cantina has attracted many of the rowdier citizens
of Tatooine.  The air is stuffy from all the people who have been in the 
building today.  A refreshing breeze blows down the stairs that you can
see to the west.

smell of exotic cigar smoke and many different types of liqueurs hang
heavily in the air.  The galaxy is huge and has bred many vices in its
inhabitants... and many of these vices are evident all around you.  
To the east a band is on the stage playing a lively tune and to the 
north is a large bar.

Many of the other creatures in the bar have gathered in front of the

to hum it.

booth is very popular whenever a band is playing in the Cantina.  As

On-Stage~

An excellent band is here playing a lively tune in the corner.  They
stand on a platform raised slightly above the level of the floor and
the corner is well-lit when compared to most of the Cantina.  The
stage is surrounded by many different creatures who have been attracted
by the skill of the musicians.  Brightly colored tapestries hang on the
wall behind the stage and lend it a splash of color lacked by so much
of the rest of the Cantina.

gifts that Jabba has given to Chalamun, for providing a place for his
operatives to enjoy themselves and conduct business.  All in all, it's fairly
small for a wookie, and apparently Jabba seems to be skimming more profits

A path into the desert~
This is where civilization ends, and the harsh reality of Tatooine's nature
takes over. For as far as the eye can see, there is nothing but endless seas
of sand. Way off in the distance you can see a tiny building which you surmise
to be Jabba's Desert Palace. Not too far off in the distance you can also see
a Jawa Sandcrawler treading its way through the dry desert. A sign nearby 
warns you not to wander aimlessly, as the Pit or Carkoon's Sarlaac has been 
known to devour many a reckless wanderer.

You are standing on a huge, featureless desert.  The remorseless 
action of the sun has blasted all the habitability out of this bleak
place. Harsh desert winds shift the huge dunes... even the oldest
residents would get lost if they weren't constantly out in the
wastes. Off in the distance you can see a huge skeleton, all that
remains of a creature long deceased.  The only residents of this
arid wasteland are widely scattered farmers, Jawa traders in their
huge Sandcrawlers, and the fierce Tusken Raiders.

In the desert wastes of Tatooine~

You are standing on a huge, featureless desert.  The remorseless 
action of the sun has blasted all the habitability out of this bleak
place. Harsh desert winds shift the huge dunes... even the oldest
residents would get lost if they weren't constantly out in the
wastes. Off in the distance you can see a huge skeleton, all that
remains of a creature long deceased.  The only residents of this
arid wasteland are widely scattered farmers, Jawa traders in their
huge Sandcrawlers, and the fierce Tusken Raiders.

You have arrived at the Skywalker homestead... not much here

At the Throne of Jabba the Hutt~

An enormous throne sits in the middle of the alcove.  Jabba and his closest
advisors are the only ones allowed here.  A tall, golden protocol droid is
here to translate for Jabba.  Sitting on the throne next to Jabba's huge
slimey tail, is a reptilian little creature with irregular tuffs of hair
around it's ears.  A beautiful girl has been chained by her neck to Jabba,
she occasionally edges farther away from the vile looking gangster.

Inside the Shuttle Tyderium's Access Ramp~

Above you, at the top of the access ramp, you can see flourescent lights
illuminating the interior of the ship.  The loud droning sound of the engines

Before the Trophy Display Room~

You stand at the beginning of a short hallway.  Dirty tapestries
hang from the disgusting walls.  A narrow staircase in the
east wall leads up into another part of the palace.  Another
narrow staircase in the west all also goes down into another
part of the palace.  At the end of the hallway to the north
you can make out a bizarre sculpture of a human.

The closer you examine the sculpture the more your skin crawls.
It appears to be of a man in terrible agony, writhing against the
deadly alloy which holds him trapped in a suffocating embrace.  The
hideous sculpture does nothing to ease your tightly strung nerves.  To
the east, a cold, DEATHly chilling breeze comes from the open *elevator
shaft*  A small, round table sits next to the sculpture.  On the table is
a small vase with some dead flowers in it and a large bowl of some weird
fruit.  The hallway leads south.  A small stairway in the west wall leads 
up into another part of the palace.

furnished to fit his every whim.  Large, heavily grated windows cover

The Galley~

The kitchen staff never rests in their unending quest to satisfy their
employer's enormous appetite.  The kitchen is extremely well equipped
and has an enormous pantry from which to draw meals.  Grimy sinks
and a sonic dishwasher serve to clean pots and pans.  A huge stove
lies up against the wall for the preparation of extremely large meals,
the kind especially common when Jabba and his lackeys are out on
one of their bizarre trips to feed the Sarlacc, with their festive
carnival atmosphere.  A door in the east wall leads into the pantry.
Loud shouts and gurgling laughter drift through the door to the west.

The Garage~

You have entered the half buried garage of a desert homestead.  Piles
of broken and salvageable equipment lie in neat stacks along the walls.
In one corner near the door a battered Skyhopper has been partly
covered by a dusty sheet of plastic.  A large oil bath sits in the
middle of the room next to a large, sturdy work bench.

The Courtyard~

You are in a large pit that serves as the central courtyard of a modest
desert homestead.  A thin stairway winds its way up one side and out onto
the desert plain above.  A large moisture vaporator stands in the middle
of the courtyard and hums quietly.

the cool air.  A large food processor sits on the sandstone counter
and a small stove sits against the west wall.

Inside the Access Tube - Sandcrawler First Floor~

Piles upon piles of scattered junk lay everywhere.  Dimly lit, you can
barely see across the room.  Droids in various states of operation lie
around with restraining bolts on, hoping to escape their enslavement.
Numerous junk items lie on the ground, most of which don't work.

Sandcrawler Control Room - Second Floor~

A large blastshield window covers the northern part of the room.  Through
the shield you can see a small water vaporator farming community.  Off in the
distance you see the vile gangster, Jabba the Hutt's Palace.  You also
notice his Sail Barge cruising beside the Pit of Carkoon, it appears Jabba
is in the mood for an execution today.  Currently the Sandcrawler is
treading slowly onwards towards a small home near Beggar's Canyon, it
must be the home of the crazy old hermit, Ben Kenobi.  The Jawa at the 
control panel punches a few buttons and brings up a map showing the 
location of all the surrounding major points of interest, such as Mos
Eisley Spaceport.
