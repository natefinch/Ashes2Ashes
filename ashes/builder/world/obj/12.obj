an Olc Sign~
An Olc Sign is taped to the wall here.~
  So you want to learn how to build, do you...

Well, here are some things you'll need to keep in mind:

1.  You will have 10 rooms, mobs, and objects to work with in zone 80.
They will all have the same vnums, ie if you have rooms 8001-8010, then
you also have mobs 8001-8010 and objects 8001-8010.  Never edit anything
outside your section as you will most likely be messing up someone else's
stuff, and they won't like that...  (:

2.  Please do not connect rooms in your section of zone 80 to rooms 
outside that section.  So you can't take a room, and connect it to the 
Temple.

3.  You will receive some Mob and Object guidelines via email.  Follow
these guidelines as if you we're building a real zone.  I do *not* want
to see any 100d100 +100 +100 weapons in there...

To my wonderful Daxx,
Today I give this ring as a symbol of my eternal love.  I give it
as I give myself to you, with all my heart and soul.  It serves as a
token of the beginning of our love.  When you wear it think of my love
for you and remember that every day we spend together will be more special
than the last and the love we have will be stronger than the day before.
Wear it in happiness and know you will always have a part of me with you.

4.  When you feel that you have practiced enough, let me know, and I will
email you the OLC Test.  Once you're finished with the test, I'll check
it with you, and if you pass, you'll get your ROI Building Permit.  Once
you have the permit, you can go bug Dyrewulf about giving you a real 
zone to work on, or find someone that is working on a zone now that 
you'd like to help on, and see if they'll let you.

5.  Have fun with this.  This is your chance leave your signature on
the mud for everyone to see.

If you run into problems, or need help with something, find me, or my 
mort Moonshine.  If I'm not here you can usually get help from just 
about any other higher up imm.
Vicious.

The claws are long, curved razors with a glint of red you determine as blood
of their owners last victim!  They have the power to be as gentle as a common
fingernail, or as deadly as Cati wishes them to be!!  You better not mess
with them, for if she sees you playing with her claws, it may be YOUR blood
that decorates them next!!!

Okay, here's the zone check list I came up with on 190. ::))

It's not in any particular order cuz I 'walked' through a zone, statting
rooms and mobs and objects...etc.

mob 19040  Sanatra is mispelled but it's prolly not important tho' people
           would make fun of you. ;)
mob 19001  You need to recheck the lying description for this mob please.
room 19000  you need to recheck your room title.
mob 19011  needs 'Peggy' in alias
obj 19022  should have 'peggy' alias
obj 19023  lower load % to 250-500, +2 +2 with barely any restricts.
obj 19035  item is nobits...load % must go down to 500
obj 19011  'player' alias needed
room 19010  the door to Marcy's house is left open
obj 19010  double load prob like DW said.
obj 19025  DW mention this one, read his recommendation
obj 19031  lower load % to 500 or so
obj 19032  'aligator' mispelled, need 'steve' in alias
obj 19039  take out alt load for same number. it will always load at 10000.
~
E
2~
obj 19046  needs 'greyhound' in alias
excuse me that was not object 19046, it's mob 19046 :)
obj 19020  drop to 2 hitrolls
obj 19021  2d17 is an illegal enchantment item.  I think we had a rule
           where the max enchantment weapon was avg 16 or 15 dam.  So you
           could just turn this into a 2d15 instead please.
obj 19049  'Anthrax' in alias please.  drop this to 2 hitrolls or drop 
           it to 250 load %  cuz 4 mobs load the same item
mob 19049  drop coins to 500000 or less, please
obj 19041  object is spelled wrong, recheck please
obj 19012  ac8 to 5 or lower
obj 19015  ac8 to 5 or lower
obj 19016  ac8 to 5 or lower
obj 19017  ac8 to 5 or lower
obj 19018  ac6 to 5 or lower
obj 19019  6d4 enchantment...okay, for now
obj 19034  alt load is the same number, this will make it load 10000, take
           out alt load please.
obj 19042  +4 dam hold obj on a not-so-difficult mob.  drop obj to +3 dam
           or beef up the stud.
~
E
3~
obj 19027  -10 armor, nope, take out affection please or make it a worn
           item.
obj 19050  Santa's bag has a max load o 750.  change this to 500 please.

Okay, this is it for now.  I didnt include some of DW's comment cuz I
didnt have time to read them as I was finishing up the check.  Please use
both check lists as a reference when correcting this area. :::)))

Nigel the Main Man ;)
