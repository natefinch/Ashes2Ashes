There is a snake coiled into the sign of infinity in the center, biting
it's own tail like the great world serpent.  The stars seems at first to
be a normal six pointed star, but when you look more carefully you see that
there are actually seven points.  As you move closer, you think you notice
movement out of the corner of your eye.  Was it a trick of the light, or
did that snake start to writhe?
