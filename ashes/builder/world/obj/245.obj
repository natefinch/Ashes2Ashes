The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that the best drink in existence
is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.. It says that the effect of drinking
a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a
slice of lemon wrapped around a gold brick.  The Guide also tells you on
which planets the best Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much
you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to
help you rehabilitate afterwards.
