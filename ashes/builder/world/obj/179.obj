sand beach ripples image sign~
The ripples dissipate leaving a circular area about 2 feet in diameter that
reflects the sky. The clouds in the reflection slowly form a face, which a
quick glance upward tells you is no longer a reflection. The face speaks:
  Hello traveler, I am Sarnoth, creator and guardian of this place.
  You are about to enter the realms of Dragonlance. Most places there are
  are fairly harmless for an adventurer of some experience, but beware,
  there is more than enough trouble to be had if you go looking for it.
  The people are for the most part kind, or at least willing to leave
  strangers alone, but look out for Kender. They are quite kind, but very
  curious and if you don't watch your items around them you may find that
  you are traveling much lighter than you thought.
As the face finishes talking, the reflection fades, and soon you are just
staring at the sand.
