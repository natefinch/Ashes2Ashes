Ashes to Ashes Handbook
Version 1.0


 Welcome to the Immortal ranks of Ashes to Ashes.  The following is 
your handbook.  It will detail your duties, responsibilities, and rules 
you must follow.  With everyone following these guidelines, Ashes to 
Ashes will prosper for a long time.

Contents:
1) Level duties and commands
2) Interference of the Mortals
3) Penalties and Freezings
4) Rewards and Promotions
5) OLC


1)  

The Wizhelp command will show you the powers you have been given by the 
administration.  These can be granted and taken away as penalties or 
rewards.

Immort:
The Immortal level is the beginning step into the world of immorts.  The 
main responsibilities of your level are: 1) building, 2) policing, and 3) 
communicating.  Building is necessary for a MUD to survive.  Without the 
diversity of new zones, we become mundane.  The next two, policing and 
communicating, are CRUCIAL to our survival.  Policing involves watching 
for cheaters, looking for zone errors, and making sure we run smoothly.  
Perhaps the most important of all is communication.  Without 
communication, we may as well not be here.  You are there to help with the 
communication between the mortal and immortal worlds.

Staff:
You are the workhorse of the MUD.  You are in direct control of the MUD in 
the absence of an Administrator.  You are the direct line between the 
Admin and the immortals.  In the absence of an Administrator, your word is 
law.


Administrator:
The Administrators and Imps make the law.  Their decision is FINAL.  they
may overrule any decision made by another Immortal.  If you have concerns 
about a decision of the Administration, please mudmail them.

===============================================================
===============================================================

2)  Interference of the Mortals

Most of the rules concerning mortals are common sense. However, here is a 
list of the definite things you CANNOT DO:

1) Loading EQ for morts.
2) Casting ANY spells on morts
3) Scoping EQ for your morts or others
4) Getting or dumping EQ in mortal world
5) Harassing mortals
6) Tanking for mortals
7) Help on a corpse retrieval as an immort
8) Have your mort and immort logged in at same time
9) Force an action onto a mortal

We do have jobs we prefer you attend to every day. These include, but are 
not limited to:

1) Check for problems or improvements that can be made to zones.
2) Watch out for newbies to the MUD.  Make sure they know how to play.
3) As stated before, watch for problems between the morts. Solve them if 
possible.

===============================================================
===============================================================

3)  Penalties and Freezings

If we find that an immort has been cheating, he will be dealt with 
severely.  If any of the previous rules are broken, they will suffer the 
following:

First offense:  Warning or Temporary freezing based on decision of 
Immortal Affairs                Dept.

Second offense:  Temporary freezing or Permanent freezing based on 
decision of
                Immortal Affairs Dept.

Third offense:  Frozen Permanently.

You are allowed to appeal a decision, but it will rarely, if ever, be 
overturned.

===============================================================
===============================================================

4)  Rewards and Promotions

Those immortals that work hard for the betterment of the MUD will receive 
rewards.  Good work includes, but is not limited to: volunteering help to 
the different depts, gaining the Admin's trust, and building or working 
will morts exceptionally well.  The most common reward will be grants.  
Maybe, with a little luck, someone will receive a promotion.

===============================================================
===============================================================

5)  OLC  (Online Creation)

We are always looking for more ideas on zones.  If you would like to build 
a zone, mail Shifter (morin@wpi.edu) with the following information:
a) Type of zone (level, theme, etc.)
b) Name of the zone
c) All workers of the zone

All zone ideas will be looked at by Shifter and the Admin.  If your zone 
is accepted, you will be granted olc and assigned zones.  If your zone is 
not accepted, don't feel bad.  Just  think up more ideas and send them in. 
 We have an olc tutor if you request one.

Some zones require special coding.  If you have any of this type, mail 
Sarnoth and discuss it with him.

One final note:  There is NO editing open zones without approval from the 
Building Dept.
