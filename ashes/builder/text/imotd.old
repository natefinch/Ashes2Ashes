Welcome to Worlds of Destiny.

Let us take this opportunity of welcome you to our immortal ranks.  Our number will grow as we 
acquire more people eager to help.

Worlds of Destiny is a 3.0 MUD, with quite a few additions of our own.  The more prominent ones 
we've added include: 100 levels, an Arena, Multiclassing, and several others.  We will be adding more 
daily, so if you have ideas, let the Admin staff hear them.

Our Administrative Staff is as follows:
Immortal Affairs: Daxx, assisted by Teddy
Mortal Affairs: Jahana
Coding: Sarnoth
Building: Shifter, assisted by Nigel
Quests: Viper

Those that have not chosen an assistant will be doing so, quickly.  If you think you're capable of 
assisting, talk to the head of that Dept.

As for everything else, read the rules, policies, etc., and we'll go from there.

***NOTE: Read my message on the board about my policy.******
