Darthius    (Jul 14) [11255] date/time stuff...make em different...just a thought
Sarnoth     (Mar 15) [ 3000] symboit attach to yourself, give powers, 
Sabretooth  (Apr 30) [20628] autoassist
Shinsa      (May  3) [24630] allow 'put 5 recall bag' command. that way players don't have to type ! several times, yet don't have to put ALL of the designated items in the container
Darwin      (May  7) [12793] a list of suggested levels for areas
Shifter     (May  7) [ 3055] hey Jesse, have "identify" have priority over idea, will ya...
Al          (May 12) [ 3054] mud credit cards
Darwin      (May 15) [ 3057] borg class (from star treck) - very high ac and lowered hp
ShadowTracker (Jun  3) [24630] I think it would be cool to have a Systime command so you can tell what time it is whereever the computer is based at..

Cassie      (Jun 28) [15696] newbies should be given torches, they start with no gold, so can't buy one
Cassie      (Jun 30) [ 3072] gossip emotes make for more interaction between players :)
Cassie      (Jul  1) [ 3072] regen rooms would be great...ones that you can go to and regenerate faster
Cassie      (Jul  1) [12063] the amount of mana that it costs to use mage spells seems to be enormous, especially for the limited time they last.  What good is it to have them if they take all your mana that you would use for healing to use 
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25004] Explain multi class more thoroughly in help...ie advantages and disadvantages
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25005] We can get some spells in midgaard for a high price...why not add some healing/restore spells?
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25005] reduce the cost of some items at stores...such as expensive sanc potions that last only 5 hours.
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25008] Aesir mud has this need set of challenge chambers.  One is used to be able to multi...of course you get better advantages to multi but the idea is that you must kill 7 special mobs to advance to multi. 
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25008] The challenge chamber is also used to allow chars that have multied a number of times to attempt to become low immortals..again they must pass tests...ie. kill mobs.
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25008] It would be cool to be granted a special skill/spell when you multi..ie. super sanc,  eagle vision.
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25008] New spells:  eagle vision - allows you to view the room of another char/mob from a distance.
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25008] quest master  A quest master would allow chars to take on lowly quests all by themselves...ie they request a quest...then have a tme limit to accomplish.  Upon successful completion, the char could get money, practs, quest points, etc.
Goddess     (Jul 29) [25008] new skill: scan - allows you to inspect for mobs in surrounding rooms
Audrey      (Jul 31) [  619] make derrick in chicago's 1920 an attackable mob, he does nothing
Goddess     (Aug  3) [ 3072] It would be nice to have a cancellation spell.
Goddess     (Aug  3) [ 3072] oops..cancellation spell would cancel all current effects on a character.
Goddess     (Aug  3) [25008] Vampire class...of course...I had to say that...but vampire class is cool especially with day/night effects.
Goddess     (Aug  3) [25020] The mud is really too easy to level in....there needs to be more balance....less access to gold...lower prices in shops...removal of wild amounts of experience on some mobs.
Goddess     (Aug  4) [25026] jump portals....these portals would allow you to go from a central place in midgaard to a desired area/zone....there could be a fee involved.  This is a good item for those without patience nor spells to get other areas.
Goddess     (Aug  4) [ 3072] The limited wish spell of the mage seems to have a quirk....why would anyone wish for gold at the cost of -1 con permanent loss???  If the spell was created, it was intended to be used....with the ease of money here, no one in their right mind should
Goddess     (Aug  4) [25004] It would be nice if the food and drink requirements were removed from level 100 chars....at this level there is not much to do and the food and drink requirement is usually handled by a trigger anyways
Goddess     (Aug  4) [25020] A mortal council...made of a group of mortals...and token imms..:)  the ouncil is responsible for mortal affairs including addressing new ideas, problems, etc.
Asita       (Aug  4) [ 1212] test
Goddess     (Aug  4) [ 3072] the relocate spell should be modified to stop people from getting into level restricted areas...ie  put level 5 in newbie area and higher level can relocate.
Goddess     (Aug  5) [15180] a phase or pass door spell would be nice for those of us without the picklock skill  :)
Goddess     (Aug  6) [ 3072] _MORE_ _CLASSES_  I do not care what...dragons would be cool....vampires too....just more classes...more fun
Goddess     (Aug  7) [ 3072] Sound!! More sound!  Mud Sound Protocol!!  
Goddess     (Aug  7) [ 3072] Goddess should be the "Idea IMM"...:P
Goddess     (Aug  7) [ 3896] It would be nice if afk had a replay command that would allow us to replay received tells while afk.
Audrey      (Aug 14) [ 3084] the ability to buy quest points with practices would be cool...
Audrey      (Aug 14) [ 8395] make the shopkeepers in Xanth's Centaur Village killable
Audrey      (Aug 16) [12062] many shops have mobs we can't fight, and
these shops aren't always in the mainstream - perhaps make these
non-important shopkeepers fightable to add interest
Legolas     (Oct 16) [3099] I want a "heal" service here at the mystery well. please :)Ashgon      (Oct 26) [20648] Make the alignment for monks be karma instead.
Guest2      (Nov 16) [    4] how about a class helpfile which lists the classes and a one-line description
Guest2      (Nov 16) [    4] rather than the backstaber being stunned for 2 ruonds, wouldn't the person being backstabbed be stunned? ;-) (continued)
Guest2      (Nov 16) [    4] thieves could backstab, pull out the blade, and then contineu somewhat quickly due to their dexterity - but the victim would have been seriously damaged, and if hit in the correct spot (continued),
Guest2      (Nov 16) [    4] such 'spots' where thieves would know to strike at the - the victim could be killed instantly - which would make sense for them to be a little shaky immediatly after a backstab
Guest2      (Nov 16) [    4] how about multiple types of poisons for poisonblade? say a thief could use poisonblade kiolat (a type of poison which causes short-term blindness) then backstab ;-)
Guest2      (Nov 16) [    4] warrior/ranger skill: grip - when a thief is successful against someone using the grip skill - their grip is disabled, but their weapon is still equiped.
Tanko       (Nov 29) [21094] Mention in the help fire that you lose xp when you flee :)
