He is remarkably neat for a pig, almost to the point of being obnoxious
but everyone has to have their hobbies, why not him too?
He hopes he doesn't see Dizzy come his way any time soon, he just got clean

She stands about 5'10" with long red hair with horns protruding up through
the locks.  She spreads her wings and her tail is positioned just right in
the back of her shorts.  She is a buxom beauty, but be warned, she is not a
weak little girl by no means having the strength of a dragon and the emotions
of a hormonal teenager, together making her a FIERCE adversary.

Dug Fin, Son of Warlock~
A short pointy eared lil demon stands here ready to 'Burn to Ash' any and all.
~
Dug Fin is the son of Warlock the leader of all the evil demons in his realm.
Dug has gained certain powers being the son of Warlock and uses them to
make people see is dad is the real deal when it comes to demons.  If you get
in his way you best be ready to face all the heat that is the sun in his
fireballs.  His Burn to Ash technique is second to none as well as his weapon
the Godslayer of Hitpoints which he pulls from the middle of his head.
He is about 4 foot tall and pointy ears protrude out from his turban and his
youth is shown when you offer him a candy bar, but beware, he hates crackers!

damaramu~
Damaramu~
Damaramu stands here looking for Mink to take her back to the king.
~
he is a proud and noble warrior, a bit on the slow side, but still a good
fighter.  he has made his name as a mercenary and the king has hired him
to kill Mink if she will not come back to the castle with him.  This
mission that Damaramu said "he shall not regret" has perhaps changed his mind.
He is said to have a brain compacted to a minute size so any shots to his
head will render no damage.  He is accompanied by his faithful companion,
Yoshi.  Can Mink escape the clutches of such a keen warrior?  I would wager
that to be a big yes!

This is more a blob like bird than any resemblance of a normal bird.  How this
creature is able to achieve flight is beyond you, but with it's claws and 
beak it could rip apart anything fleshy.  Mink is to be the next meal on this

Geese Howard~
The king of south town, Geese Howard determines you are not worth his effort.
~
Standing about 6 foot tall and with the same shade of blonde hair as Terry
Bogard, Geese is the undisputed king of south town, and Terry and Andy's
worse enemy.  Geese killed their father right in front of them when they
were boys, and drove them to become the fighting machines they are today.
Geese was barely defeated by Terry thanks to the Hapioku-Saiken's final
attack.  Geese has sought revenge ever since and will not rest until he
beats Terry Bogard.

wolfgang krauser~
Wolfgang Krauser~
Wolfgang Krauser is here looking for someone to give him a challenge.
~
He stands about 6'8" with dark hair and even darker eyes.  He sends a feeling
of power through you to the very core making your hair stand on end.  He
killed his father when he was 16 to take over the family of Stroheim.
He sought out Terry as he has felt unchallenged since the day he killed his
father barehanded, and was rather disappointed when he beat Terry almost
as easy.  Terry however came back and beat Krauser to regain his title of
world's best fighter.  Krauser is a most deadly fighter relying on brute
force and speed which make him unmistakably a force to be reckoned with.

Mai Shiranui~
Mai Shiranui stands here wrapped around the arm of her beau, Andy Bogard.
~
The one and only Independant Dual Suspension Ninja Girl is here and looking
to give you the fight of your life.  She calmly looks at you and asks you
not to underestimate her just because she is a woman.  She is wearing a
rather semi revealing uniform that has two strips of cloth that run right
down the middle of her chest making the reason she is called I.D.S. obvious
with each bounce she does.  You wonder how Andy can always push her aside or
just ignore her advances.  She wields fans that are metallic and razor sharp.
This ninja girl is here to play!

Laocorn Gaudeamus~
A skinny lil boy with a gleam in his eye and a fireball in hand is here.
~
After his father was killed by a jealous associate who sought the power of
The Armor of Mars which his father discovered the legend to and were direct
descendants of the Gaudeamus who wore the 6 pieces at once and became a God
back in the old Roman empire.  Laocorn has made it his personal mission to
find all the pieces and become the most powerful being in existance.  The
only thing stopping him is his twin sister Sulia who has gone to seek
out the one man who can stop this, Terry Bogard.  Laocorn refuses to rest
until he has all the armor and can take over the world.

Sulia Gaudeamus~
A small, scared little girl is here looking for Terry Bogard to help her.
~
Sulia is blue haired (it's anime, blue hair is not a problem) and very strong
willed, she can heal herself or others to a certain degree.  She has sought
Terry Bogard to help her stop her brother from finding the Armor of Mars
which will bring about an evil curse if he succeeds.  In so finding Terry
and ataining his help she falls for the "Lone Wolf" as does he for her.
She is very attractive and will do anything to stop her brother from getting
the armor.

jamin~
Jamin~
Jamin is here ready to assist Laocorn but secretly yearning for Sulia.
~
He stands about 6 and a half feet tall and has red spiked hair and a look of
discontent at your having stepped into his domain.  He is as strong as
Krauser and possibly stronger with his Earthquaker technique, which is
similar to Terry's Power Wave technique.  He is always serving Laocorn to
help him get the Armor of Mars but he secretly longs to be with Sulia.
His final act in fighting Terry is the indication of this, he let himself be
defeated by terry so that Terry could save Laocorn and in turn Sulia.
He is a warrior of noble stature and will only fight fair rather than cheat
or resort to tactics his associate Hauer would.

Panni~
Panni can control the very element of water as she has a wave crash into you.
~
A very arrogant woman with a desire to please Laocorn and get him his Armor
of Mars and she hates Mai for her cutesy ways and seeks to beat her at any
chance.  She is the master of water as Jamini is the master of fire and
Hauer is the master of air.  She can order the water to crash you into a
wall at a mere glance or a whim.  She does not seem impressed at your 
eyeing your spandexed body over, you had better leave.

hauer~
Hauer~
The most deadly master of the air is here, Hauer is not amused with you.
~
Hauer, the deadly master of air, is whom you are looking at.  He wears a gold
mask to protect his face from injury much as Vega in Street Fighter.  It
is decorated with a feather in the middle and when he removes the mask all the
ladies drool >except for Mai who still thinks he's not as cute as Andy<.
The fact Mai indicated this to him makes him hate Andy all the more.  Hauer
does not get along with his cohort very well in that Jamin is such a good
sport and Panni is such a follower that he truly dislikes them all.  He does
however fear Laocorn which buys his loyalty.  Hauer can summon a tornado
or a nice strong gust to knock you into a nearby wall leaving a crater a
foot deep, or he may just use the sheer force of it to cut your head off.
Either way he is not a opponent to be taken lightly.

Terry has a very thin build and with his biker gloves and baseball cap he looks
like a normal kid, but his fighting skills are unmatched in the world, except
maybe by his brother Andy.  Terry was chosem by his master to carry the lost
technique of channeling the power of the Earth and focusing it into his body
so all you see is a whirlwind of punches and kicks.

A man of pale skin and narrow eyes forged by the most skilled of craftsmen it

to which nothing you have ever known has ever been.  His sword as long as he
is tall with a slight curve and very narrow and very sharp hangs over his
shoulder in a sheath.  He looks up at you and his eyes glow blue for an instant
and you realize he is not of human blood, or not completely anyway!

Kaneida~
A young man stands here defiantly against the world and his best friend
~
Forced to try and stop the raving Tetsuo, Kaneida had the misfortune of being
caught in the Akira blast that leveled Neo-Tokyo for a second time.  He saw
how it all began and how it came to a close.  He wears a red leather jacket
with the picture of a two colored cylinder on the back.  He rides the state
of the art in motorcycles.  He is a force to be reckoned with by sheer will
alone!

tetsuo~
Tetsuo~
A boy with a long flowing red cape cackles maniacally at you as you enter
~
The small lad is only about 5 foot tall for someone of age 15 he is a runt and
is always being picked on by others or teased by even his friend Kaneida.  He
has unbelievable power in his mind and can easily blow you to shreds if he
concentrates hard enough.  You look and see in his eyes he has lost all  reason
and rationale, you had better leave before he sees you as a threat.

Akira~
A boy stands here glowing and humming faintly, his eyes show power
~
Although Akira is but a 10 year old frame he has the power to destroy a single
city with a mere thought.  His powers limitations are still unknown to us, but
you can bet he is not one to be toyed with.  His eyes show power and a
definate knowledge of how to use it.  You had better leave.

the GuyverIII~
The GuyverIII stands here plotting his next move, against who is unknown
~
Standing seemingly taller than the powerful Guyver, GuyverIII is here to maybe
back up Sho or perhaps to put his friends in greater danger, no one knows what
his true intentions are.  What is known is Agito is familar with how to use
the bio booster armor more so than Sho, and Agito loves to demonstrate this.
You had better leave since this "Dark Knight" has more knowledge, more power
and more determination than any character than you have ever seen.

middle of his forehead, the Guyver looks like he means buisness.  The powers
of this remarkable bio booster armor are still not fully known to its owner,
but what the owner does know is deadly enough to blow away acres of trees in
a single blast, you had better not mess with him of his friends!

cut. Her waist is small and you follow it around and notice her meaty tush.
The blonde, blue eyed babe walks up to you and asks "Can I help you?" You
think to yourself, "If you only knew honey!" She's not bad...
She's just drawn that way!!!
