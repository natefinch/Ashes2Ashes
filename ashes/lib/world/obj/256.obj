Taking a closer look at this little mushroom, you see it looks almost exactly
like a portabella, except for it's grey coloring. It looks pretty tasty. You
think it's safe to eat.

log rotten rot~
You take a closer look at the log.... It's very large log. It must have once
been a great tree like the ones that surround you. Mushrooms grow all over
it's surface. They look pretty apettizing too.

fruit piece fru~
As you examine the fruit, you realize you've never seen anything of it's kind
before. I looks almost like a cross between an apple and orange, having the
the shape of an apple, but the texture & color of an orange.

You look at the corpse of a woodlander and feel pity for the poor guy that
lost his life here. Whatever killed him was not nice about it either, the
corpse has been badly mauled. It almost looks as if it has been chewed upon.

torch woodlander wood~
Taking a closer look at the torch you see it's made of some cloth wrapped
around a stick and dipped into some smelly solution. It'd probably last for
at least a day.

Looking at the sword you see it's not the best quality weapon you've ever
seen, but it looked like it fit it's purpose. It's slightly soiled, and
almost looks as if it was recently used.
