 HERE LIES MIDGAARD: GRAVEYARD OF FOOLS
 ======================================
 At the height of it's power, the Immortals of Midgaard became giddy with
 their power and began to neglect the safety of the mortals whose worship
 gave them their power.  The True Gods had chosen to ignore the actions of
 their underlings, and the nuclear fallout from the teleportation and
 destruction of monsters and players alike began to poison the mortals who
 lived here.  In the end, the mortals died of the sickness, pleading to the
 Gods for assistance, but none came.  And, with their deaths, the immortals
 lost their powers, and found that they too had become succeptable to the
 poison they created, and they too died.  This sign should serve as a
 warning to any who would attempt this again, so speaks Odin this day!
