mystra power divine part great greater mystras~
This is a cache of power that Mystra entrusted to Elminster when the overgod,
Ao, cast the gods from the planes and stripped them of their powers. The only
mortal who was capable of holding her power while she was gone, Elminster
knew better than to ever try to wield such might. But it's your call now. The
power of a godess is a tempting treasure to leave unused.

hat battered old elminster elminsters~
This hat has definitely seen better days. Worn and wrinkled, the fabric of
the hat has lost its stiffness, causing the brim to droop a little. The dye has
also faded, leaving what was undoubtedly once a brilliant red, now a reddish
brown hue. Despite its many flaws, it is quite comfortable...why else would
Elminster keep it?
