shadows shadow moon moonshadow moonlight light midnight~
These dark shadows consist of everything dark and mysterious.  They are
the cloak that shrouds MidKnight at all times.  They seem to writhe and
expand as you stare at them, reaching out tendrils of deepest night to
draw your soul inward.  The touch is cool, yet not uncomfortable, and you
find yourself yearning to be a part of the darkness.

This is the essence of the Night itself, terribly powerful.  Its use is

star midknight~
 Looking at the star, it seems to glow and hum before your very eyes.
There is a snake coiled into the sign of infinity in the center, biting
it's own tail like the great world serpent.  The stars seems at first to
be a normal six pointed star, but when you look more carefully you see that
there are actually seven points.  As you move closer, you think you notice
movement out of the corner of your eye.  Was it a trick of the light, or
did that snake start to writhe?
