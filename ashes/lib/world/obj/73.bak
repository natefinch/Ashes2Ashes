Flee sign~
A sign to teach wimpy and flee stands here.  ~
Fleeing is a way to get out of a fight.  To use flee, you must
type: flee.  Iyou flee from a battle, you will lose experience
points, but it will save you from the 25% chance of con loss if
you die.  Flee doesn't always work, so you may have to do it more
than once to get out of a battle.  Flee will take you into a room
surrounding the room you fled from.

Wimpy is a way to have the computer flee for you.  To use wimpy,
you must type: wimpy {a number less than your max hit points}
Wimpy will have the computer try to flee for you when your current
hit points is less than the current wimpy setting.
Example:
Your maximum is 30 hit points and your current is 22.  You type:
wimpy 20.  A creature hits you and you lose 4 hit points so your
current hit points will be 18.  The computer will try to flee since
you have 18 hit points which is less than the current wimpy
setting of 20.

Con sign~
A sign to teach you consider stands here.~
Consider is used to compare your level and the creatures level.
To use consider, type: consider {creature} or con {creature}
Consider will give you a message depending on your level and how
much higher or lower the creature is.
The messages are:
You ARE mad!   The mob is MUCH higher than you.
Are you mad??   Mob has a lot of levels on you, probably 20 or so.
Do you feel lucky punk?   Mob has probably 15 levels on you.
You would need a lot of luck.   The mob has you by about 5-10 levels.
The perfect match!  You and the mob are the same level.
Easy. You have the mob by about 1-5 levels.
Now where did that chicken go.   Should be a real easy fight.  You
have the mob by 5-10 levels.
These are only to be used as a reference. Levels are not always
accurate, but they are usually close.

No Rent sign~
A sign to teach renting and quiting stands here.~
There is no formal rent here.  Just quit and leave where ever you
want. There is a maximum of 35 items which you can save here.  You
can't quit with more than 35 items.  If you lose link, we give you
1 hour to come back.  If you do not come back within 1 hour, you
are force-saved. If you have over 35 items, the game will take the
items that have the least monetary value.  This may mean you lose
a lot of good equipment.  Please try to get back within the hour we
give to save your equipment.  When you return to game, if you quit
you start where you quit.  Don't try to use quit to get back to the
temple. If you come back from a crach or force-save, you will start
in the temple.

Help is used to teach you how to do things or give you information 
about things you're not sure about.  The way to use the help file
is to type: help <word>, with <word> being the word you want help
on. If you try to find help on something, but can't seem to find
any help on it, tell an immortal and they will make sure it gets
updated in the help file.

Most muds have gotten rid of deathtraps (dt), but we think
that it adds a little spice to the game and makes characters
a bit more cautious.  The old saying "look before you leap"
works well here.  If you are in a new (to you) area make sure
you read the room description that you're in before you go any
farther. If you still have questions if the next room is a
dt then look in that direction (type: look <direction>).  Usually,
if it is a dt then the creator of that area has given you some
warning either in the description of the room, or in the description
of the exit.  Remember that it is a deadly world out there.

First of all, type practice.  The first line should say " you have <#>
practices left."  This is the number of practices that you can use. 
Under that line is a list of your skills and the level that you can
learn each skill at.  If, instead of a level it says <not known> it 
means that you can learn that skill now.  Choose one of these skills
that you can learn and practice that.  It is wise to practice the main
skill you will be using up to superb because you will be better at
it then others, depending on what it is, it could mean that you can
hit more often, or heal more often than failing.  

After that you're on your own to remember to use your new skills.

there is a whole mess of things that you and others players can
do to each other (all in fun of course).  So just type 'SOCIALS'
and take a look at all the fun stuff you can do.  Then go out and
practice on the mobs to see what they do.

Midgaard is a very safe place, but once you begin to wander away from
Midgaard it is very wise to carry at least one scroll of recall with you.
There are certain places in these realms that are very difficult to
get out of without a scroll of recall.  Also, if you are finding it
impossible to flee during combat, a scoll of recall is a good way to
get out of the fight, if you are in a room that lets you recall from
it, without dying and losing your equipment.

Doors can be tricky even if they aren't locked and you have to find
a key.  They reason is because they can be called so many different things.
Just because it is a door doesn't mean it's going to be called a door.
There are a variety of ways to find out what they are called.  One of
these ways is to guess, another is to look in the direction you think the
door is (that will tell you what is closed), the third is to just walk
in every direction that doesn't have a door and it will tell you what
is closed.  Every wall in this room has a door by a different name
then all the other doors.  Some of them are commonly used throughout
the realms.  Try your luck at opening all of these doors.

An identify (ID) scroll can be use for a variety of things.  Not only
can it be used to find out how good a weapon is or what affections are
on an object, but it can also be used to find out your HitRoll (how
good your chances are to hit the monster) and your DamageRoll (how
much damage you could possibly do when you hit the monster).  You
can also use these scrolls on mobs to find out certain things, for 
example, thieves would like to know if certain mobs are !sharp which
means thier piercing weapons that they use for backstab won't work on
the mob, which is VERY deadly to thieves.  Use an ID scroll and it
will tell you if the mob is !sharp or not.  It will also give you
the other Affections of the mob.  Using an ID scroll along with conning
a mob is a very safe way to go through the realms.
