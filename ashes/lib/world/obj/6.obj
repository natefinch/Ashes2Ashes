                            Stairway to Hell

   As they walked up the stairs under the light of the full moon, Sandy
felt like she was being watched.  The old railroad ties dug into her
shoes and the cool October air blew her long sandy-blonde hair away from
her face.  Sandy stopped at the Poplar tree to wait for the others to
catch up and clanced at the tree.  Running her fingers across the back
she fingered the initials that Mike had carved into it a year ago to
state his love for her.  Turning around, she looked back into the 
graveyard, but nothing was there.  Mike put his hand on her arm and
looked at her, by looking at his face, Sandy knew he felt it too.
   The stairs were called "Stairway to Hell" because, as the story
goes, when someone died and was buried in that cemetery, their spirit
would go up to the top of the stairs to begin their journey down.  If
they disappeard before or when they reached the bottom, they have
gone to hell.

   If they don't disappear they will turn around and walk back up the
stairs.  If they make it to the top, they ahve gone to heaven.
   Not many spirits have made it back to the top.

   Sandy turned around and followed Mike with her Ouija board in hand.
"After all," she thought, "It's only a harmless little game."
   When Sandy first walked inot the little cemetery lot located on
top of the stairway, she knew something was going to happen, she just
didn't know what.  Soemthing lingered in the air, but she assumed it
was her own fear that was disturbing her so much.
  Sandy and her friends decided to try the Ouija board on top of one of
the tombstones.  They figured that way they would get the best results.
   It seemed like hours before they received even a slight response.
All of them had tried to contact the spirits, but only with Mark and
Sandy on the Ouija board did it give even a slight response and soon

This is the latest issue of Penthouse magazine, fresh off the press!  You are
so excited that you almost drop is as you turn the first page.  This magazine
is packed full of beautiful, and naked, women in all types of suggestive
poses.  There is even an article on bondage written by Diva, the blonde
dominatrix.  As you eagerly flip through the pages, your jaw drops to the 
ground as you get to the centerfold.  You'd better wipe that drool off your
chin before someone notices...

plays nothing but love songs.  The sound quality is absolutely perfect.
You could loose yourself in that romantic music...
