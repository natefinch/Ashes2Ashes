band~
One single lost soul searching the cold and dark night
looking for the love they call Mr. Right
Soon she discovers another lost soul
who lights a candle and makes her whole
soon that candle has grown tall and like their love no longer small
Hotter and higher the flame still grows 
where out love shall end only the gods may know
Love shall be our Heaven on Earth
I love you - Freedom~
