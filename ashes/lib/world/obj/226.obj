statue~
The statue is life-sized, and great care was taken to capture even the most
minute details - right down to the Sultans eyelashes.  You could almost swear
it was the Sultan himself looking down at you.  It stands on a white marble
pedestal, about two feet off the palace floor.

ring~
This is by far the largest diamond you will ever see in your lifetime.  It
dazzles your eyes as it catches even the tiniest of light, and reflects them
all around you.  The stone itself is a pale sky blue, perfectly cut, and
slightly smaller than a chestnut.  The band is a highly polished solid gold.
