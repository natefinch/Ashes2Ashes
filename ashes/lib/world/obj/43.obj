night~
This is the essence of the Night itself, terribly powerful.  Its use is
shaped by the intent of its owner.  The power can only be fully controlled
by MidKnight himself, all others attempting to do so, slowly lose their
lifeforce to the devouring hunger of the darkness.

These dark shadows consist of everything dark and mysterious.  They are
the cloak that shrouds MidKnight at all times.  They seem to writhe and
expand as you stare at them, reaching out tendrils of deepest night to
draw your soul inward.  The touch is cool, yet not uncomfortable, and you
find yourself yearning to be a part of the darkness.

star midknight~
 Looking at the star, it seems to glow and hum before your very eyes.
There is a snake coiled into the sign of infinity in the center, biting
it's own tail like the great world serpent.  The stars seems at first to
be a normal six pointed star, but when you look more carefully you see that
there are actually seven points.  As you move closer, you think you notice
movement out of the corner of your eye.  Was it a trick of the light, or
did that snake start to writhe?

This is Jericho's wedding ring, it's match buried along with his wife.  In a
huge war seven years ago, Jericho's wife, Sarah, was caught in a town
ransacked by the enemy.  Jericho fought valiantly, killing dozens of men
before he was captured.  Unfortunately he could do nothing to save his wife,
who was killed before they could be reunited.  Swearing vengeance on the
soldiers of the town, and the entire enemy, Jericho escaped his prison and
killed the rest of the army in the town.  But nothing could bring back his
wife.

This wrist armor was blessed by the tears of the innocent children Jericho
fought to protect in a battle long ago.  Made of a strange deep purple metal,
it sparkles in anything but the deepest darkness, showing the power of
sacrifice for another. Jericho gave the bracer to MidKnight after he saved
Jericho's life.

This is the essence of all that is wonderful in childhood.  The ability to

This is the very essence of the darkness MidKnight controls.  It writhes
around you, seeking to devour your life force.  Those who control this
powerful entity gain extraordinary powers of regeneration, though they soon
discover the sword has two edges.  The power is a curse upon the wielder, in
short order making his life into a neverending nightmare.

This is the sword Samantha received from her god for long and faithful

blade shines, always kept magically sharp. On the blade of this magnificent
sword is written the word JUSTICE. You can feel the power in this weapon,
though you can tell it can only truly be wielded by one pure of heart and
resolute of spirit.

This armor was forged by Samantha's boyhood friend, Jeremiah.  When Samantha
took up her sword, he turned to blacksmithing, while at first she chided him
for his choice, she is now proud to be his friend, as he is known to be the
best armorsmith in the kingdom. The armor holds great enchantments,
strengthening it against attacks. But even aside from its magic, the armor is
a wonderful piece of work. Intricate designs are engraved over the entire
armor, finer than any King's ceremonial armor.  They say you can see the
shine from a mile away.
