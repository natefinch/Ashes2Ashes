                   Welcome to the Forgotten Realms, friend!
   The vast region is full of interesting people and places. With luck, you may be able to
explore all the Realms. However, be warned. Outside of Waterdeep the world can be a
very dangerous place. If you are low level, you probably don't want to venture outside the
gates of the city alone. Also keep in mind that only the most heinous (and brainless) of
mobs will attack you without reason. For the most part, many of them will leave you alone.
For those that are agressive, you should be able to tell from context. If you pay attention
to descriptions and room names, you should be ok.
   Have Fun!! I hope you enjoy my little world :)
