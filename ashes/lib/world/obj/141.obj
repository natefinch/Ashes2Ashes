chap1~
Story of Grimwall: In a land far away....No, actually, in THIS land, there
lives a king, some tree people, and some ugly mosters. (Sounds interesting
right?) The king was the King of Graven, King Rancoth. He is a very powerful
king and does not like those who disobey or disrespect him, the punishment
for those who do is usually immediate death. (Not a nice guy.) The people of
Graven tolerate his rule only because it is all they have known and they fear
him. In the land of Grimwall also lives a peaceful people who live in the
woods (Woodlanders). They have a small treehouse community and live in
seclusion from the rest of the kingdom. Until recently, the existance of the
woodlanders had been merely a wives tale passed down over the generations,
but now one of them was caught by garrison of guards exploring the lighter
portion of the woods. King Rancoth sees the Woodlanders as a potential enemy,
so he has ordered the capture and imprisonment of all of them.
~

chap3~
The people of Graven are catagorized into 2 sections, those that inhabit
Graven castle, and those who inhabit Graven village. Both of these are
regular, ordinary people, so I will not elaborate on them. consider this
chapter a waste.
~
E
chap2~
There is one slight problem with the King's order, Darkendale Forest, which
in turn is inhabited by a species of monster unknown, all that is known is it
feeds upon the flesh of thoses foolish enough to enter the woods. No one will
dare enter the woods in search of the Woodlanders. The Woodlanders: The
Woodlanders have had a history of being an peace & nature loving people.
Until recently, they have never had aneed for weapons, but they realize the
potential danger they are in and are preparing for a possible war in which
they are sure to lose. Their only advantages being their cunning and
remarkable woodsmanship abilities. They have also developed a way of keeping
the monsters away, light. They discovered long ago that the monsters fear
light itself and that is the reason for their main inhabitance of the dark
woods.

The monters of the Dark Woods: These are a centuries old family of creatures
that have been inhabiting these woods since the dawn of time. The legend goes
that a group of cave men turned cannibalistic and where exiled from their
community for thier man eating practices. They then went into the woods and
where never heard from again. Frequently a person from the village nearby
would go missing in the middle of the night. Their muffled screams and the
sound of footsteps the only sound. No trace was ever left. So as the story
goes, the cannibals became more and more animal like over the centuries, but
never losing their intelligence. And so they still dwell in the darker
regions of Brickstone forest today. Occasionally a tortured screams escapes
from the woods late at night. Only to be silenced again.
