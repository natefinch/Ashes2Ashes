sign~
Rerolling was once a dangerous practice, but it is now quick and painless :)
All you need to do is type list to find out how much it will cost, and get
the cash together. Then type reroll. You go to a screen like the stat screen
where you created your character. When you have the stats you want, just
accept them, and you will apear back in the game with the new stats. There
are a few catches. The first is, you start over at level 1 in your current
class when you reroll. The second is, you don't gain practices until you are
above the level you rerolled at. Also, you lose all spare practices you do
not use.  Finaly, each time you reroll, it gets more expensive. Note- It is
not productive to reroll a single class character, as you lose the practices
and all your mana, hp etc down to where you would have them at first level.
