piece tarrasque carapace~
This chunk of carapace is jagged and sharp, as a result of the fact
that the only way it could come off the Tarrasquewas for the creature's
own immense weight to crush it's carapace when it died. Too bad that
the carapace is so nearly indestructible, or it could be made into a
truly legendary shield. If only you knew of a good enough armor-smith.

tarrasque shield carapace rimmed mithril~
This shield is made from the carapace of the legendary Tarrasque. It
was forged in fires blessed by Moradin, and crafted by the skilled hand
of Buster Bracer, foremost of dwarven armor-smiths. It seems strong
enough to stand up to the impact of a meteor! (you'd still get crushed,
but the shield would most likely be fine)

cyrinishad book lies~
  This is the life story of Cyric, God of Death, Murder, Lies, Tyranny,
etc, told by the god himself. As you read the book you learn of the
hypocrisy of Truth and Honor, and the value of taking control over your
own Fate. The more you read of the book, the more you believe in what
the book is telling you. That's the trap...it's too late for you now. The
magic of the Cyrinishad is powerful enough to warp the mind of even a
god. You try to put the book down, but as the words on the page burn
themselves into your very soul, you find that you no longer have the
willpower.

Gond to outfit Cyric's "Holy" Inquisitors. The armor itself stands roughly
nine feet tall, and is bolted into the body, with springs replacing muscles
and mechanisms enhancing the senses. The suit completely repels
all magic, and is all but indestructible -- even the sword Godsbane was
unable to penetrate it.

vestments of Leira's clergy, which can obscure height and build, the
