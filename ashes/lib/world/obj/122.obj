helm visor darksteel ornate~

You see before you a finely crafted helm made from that mysterious
darksteel metal indigenous only to the astral plane. Ornate decorations
cover much of the surface: tiny skulls, swords, flowers, droplets of
what seems to be blood...

belt plate-link~

This belt is very old, very ancient - the knowledge to craft and
ensorcel such artifacts of power long lost. It saps your strength
and your vitality to channel it into raw destructive powers.
Do not be surprised if it suddenly disappears... That is a risk
you take.

This is just a membership roll off the top of my head, please let
me know the new members (in fact, please have all potential members
come talk to me before they're fully accepted - both because I want
to hope they know enough about us to join, and also so I can keep
a rollsheet. Here goes:

around in a while)
Kylee, Kitty, Jeraan, Jera, Dritz, Dromacus, Allanon, Ann, Herb, Tino,

Jeraan, Ezekiel, Ryder, me (Raul), Tanrithel, Angela, Adriana, Tron
Lyonis, Imagination, Seraphine, Toran, Reyals, Sethe, Linna...
(I'm sure there could be a few I forgot :( please do speak up if I
forgot you.)

disbanded and all are gone or left or deleted)
Blayde, Duncan, Aragorn, Sylph, Dorna, Eresbit, Saben, Jeraan...

Thanks

news~
Brother Sethe and I talked for a while, and he and I somehow 'grew'
alittle (amazing ain't it? on a mud?) in terms of wisdom...
Anyway, the idea is that the Creed is really something, not just a
buncha rhetoric. Once we got past that, we somehow realized how
true it was that the Creed works because,
You're only truly just if you have mercy, and you're only truly
merciful, if you are just...
The same works with the others... You're not really being logical
unless you're compassionate, nor are you compassionate without being
logical. As for honor and humility, you can figure that for yourself...

Additionally, I've found some of you don't know too much about some of
the (few) rules we have...
It's okay to kill good-aligned mobs. This is a mud, not a roleplay mud
or a real life situation. You need items, and good items are often on
good aligned mobs. You also need xp and gold. So go for it. You know
you'd not really do it in real life or against another player..

     The Creed

'Let mercy temper thy justice.
 Let compassion lace thy logic.
 Let humility guide your honor.'

rose red~
This single long-stemmed rose is so beautiful and so exquisitely shaped...
It was cut only yesterday, and has been magically preserved fresh. Even
now the floral scent drifts to you nose and you smell something spicy and
tangy...
...and you feel like spring is in the air!

This is a nicely made box which has been made from a base of 50% post-
consumer recycled paper. The outsides have been laminated a shiny and
tasteful reddish sheen. Upon the top cover is stamped in decorative gold
foil lettering the brand, 'Realms Chocolatiers, Ltd.' Below it are two
gold hearts joined by an arrow, also of stamped foil.
...a tag attached is printed, 'To my sweetheart, with love.'
