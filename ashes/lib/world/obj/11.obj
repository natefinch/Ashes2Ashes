Yet another item of legend. But only one may invoke it's true

outside and inside. You do not seem to understand them.

rapier~
This rapier boasts the much favored swept hilt design known
as the 'Cavalier' hilt. The guard is flat, spiral-shaped, with
a knuckle bow providing protection to the hand.
The blade, however, is what is of note. Of gleaming greyish
blue elven steel crafted in the 'thousand-fold' style, it also
seems to have been enchanted, if the softly, faintly heard
humming emanating from it seems to be any indication.
Overall, this is an excellent weapon.

axe~
The dwarves are normally not known for beauty in their works,
but this one is an exception. Forged in the smithies deep
within their granite halls, using the living, flowing rock
itself as the source of heat, this double-bladed mithril axe
not only is sturdy and near indestructible (as is to be expected
of dwarven craft), but also a magnum opus in terms of artistic
skill. The deeply etched runes, carved in such a manner, show that
while they may not paint or draw, they sure have their art!

splinters have been removed, and it boasts a good heft and

knocked unconscious with this in order to be carried off to

pike~
This is a halfling polearm intended for use against Big People
troublemakers. The length of the pike gives short arms a longer
reach, as well as helps keep attackers at bay. The hook is useful
for pulling opponents to the ground or ripping away armor.
For peacekeeping among fellow halflings, shiriffs tend to prefer
using cudgels...

This is a true piece of dwarven smithcraft. The helmet itself
is very sturdy and made from blackened steel. Gold filigree has
been inlaid upon the black finish in the blocky and swirling
patterns of runic decorations. Two curving ox-horns, only about
four inches long each, are practically pointed downwards to help
deflect blows at the neck. Only stupid smiths point the horns up,
and dwarves are not stupid.

accomodate halfling body size limitations. The blade looks
wickedly sharp, but the weight and awkward positioning of
the scythe as a whole gives you doubts as to your ability to
wield. Surely you will be sacrificing accuracy and strength.
