sign arena quest~
So I don't hear about any complaints about what realm you step into, here
is a list of the realms and their abilities.
North, South, East, West
These are the standard areas of Arena Quest.  Each of them are 3 by 3 grids
with a ring out circling them.
Northwest
This is also a 3 by 3 grid.  However there's more challenge as the rooms
are all equipped with Dt's that will repeatedly drain your life.


Northeast.
This is a 5 by 5 grid.  This is for those who feel there isn't enough room to
move around. ;)

Up
Nicknamed the Sky Stage, it's aptly named as it's only one room surrounded by
ring outs.  This is not a place to have a wimpy on. ;)

Down
Last but not least, it's The Void.  This is a 3 by 3 by 3 wraparound gird of fun.
There are no Ring Outs, and Honorable Deaths are not allowed.  It's a true fight
to the finish.
Have fun with these and if there are any problems, let me know.

assassin beamer~
This is a small device that fits over the hand.
On the inside are buttons that will transport the user
to the tournament arena. On the outside are flashing
status lights. It seems to be in working order, but you
really can't tell.
