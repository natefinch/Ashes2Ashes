When you look upon the blade itself, you realize how old this weapon is.
You marrvel at it's beauty though, because it's blade has been folded over
1500 times! It's hilt in the shape of a dragon, clutching a magnificent
star sapphire shows the very spirit of he who once wielded this weapon...
