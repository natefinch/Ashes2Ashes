razor razorknife knife~

A thin piece of high quality ceramic produced cheaply in null-grav labs
in the LaGrange orbitals. The razorknife needs no sharpening, and will
maintain an edge sharper than any metal razor for a long time. One reason
the handguard is rather sturdy and a built in part of the entire one-piece
is to avoid slippage that could cause your fingers to be fillet'd and
sliced clean off. Mass exports such as these help to keep such Orbitals
as Sovstation, Europort, and Neo-Coalition (as well as a host of smaller,
less well-funded ones) in business.

mag hustler porn magazine pornography~

There are a good number of ads for vidphone numbers (and plain voice
numbers if you can't afford a vidphone) for those interested in phone
sex. These, and other ads put there by holo-porn companies and mail-order
supply sources, seem to take up almost half of the pages! They typically
feature a nude blonde or brunette holding a phone and spreading their
labias apart with their fingers or playing with dildos. A few are gay,
lesbian, and bi advertisements.
     Finally, your eyes feast on this month's (well, several years ago's)
centerfold. In a series of delightful photo-spreads (yes, pun included),
buxom Ellen undresses herself and reveals each and every one of her soft,
intimate charms to the reader. You find yourself very much aroused by
all this (even if you're female!) because this woman just seems to have
this... magnetism! Whoo! You begin to feel hot and horny...

eji cloak~

House of Eji has always been known for the simple, understated elegance
of their clothing creations. This one here is no exception. A trifle on
the bloody side perhaps, but nothing a good dry-cleaner cannot fix! You
have before you a finely crafted black armor cloak, imbued with the best
protection and bio'face circuitry money can buy...

briefs america captain~

Inspiring, aren't they? These are old briefs, and very stretched due to
the size of the wearer, who is certainly not a kid anymore. He must have
kept them as his lucky drawers...
     There's Captain America, in his costume, with his magic shield, and
there he is in another scene fighting the bad guys of crime...
Heh.

belt chastity~

This odd belt has several loops that wind around the top of the male
sac and tightens it, showing the outline of the testicles more easily.
Another buckle wraps around the base of the shaft, and if made tight,
will cause the head and overall length to become engorged with blood.

news~
1. You may kill good mobs in your search for xp, gold, and equipment.
2. Always try to stay good, or at least on the positive side of zero.
3. The guild does not encourage its members to preach about Sanctus to 
   those who dont ask.   But if they are interested, by all means, feel 
   free to talk.  It helps you to keep the information fresh in your own 
   mind, without being overbearing.
4. Try to learn as much as you can, and to build your own educated
   opinion on Sanctus. Share your thoughts with fellow members, and 
   discuss how each views the guild.  Then share your thoughts with those 
   who ask you about us. It allows them to better understand our guild.
5. You may group with others, not only fellow brethren.  You may decline 
   an appeal for aid if you feel you must. We help when we can and when 
   we are able, for goodness' sake, and not for the glory of anyone. That 
   is why humility plays such an important role.

update updates~
The study of the Creed is basic to the guild of Sanctus.  Each member
represents the whole, by merely accepting membership.  Please think
about how your actions will affect each player in the game when you do
something. Take the Creed, study it, allow it to show thru in your
playing and maybe, just maybe, it might have an effect on your real
life as well.  Have fun and play nice, my fellow brethren. - MacLeod

can SMASH~

SMASH is the newest cheap commercial drink to hit the market. It is a
mild euphoric, with trace elements that also produce hallucinogenic and
saddictive qualities similar to caffeine, but stronger. It's not fully
replaced alcohol yet, but the effects and the cost are making it more and
more popular, especially among the poor.
