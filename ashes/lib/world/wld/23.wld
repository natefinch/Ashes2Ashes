The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

The small intersection in the forest~
The forest path splits here in three directions. Small paths lead to the east,
north, and south. The trees above leave a gap which allows light to fill the
intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

The edge of the forest and hills~
You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A path leads north into the forest and
its deadly darkness and silence. Looking west, you see a path that leads up
into a foothills region. Standing here on the boundary between light and
darkness, you feel very vulnerable and alone.

In the dense forest~
You walk along a small path leading through a dark forest. No sounds can be
heard and little light penetrates the canopy of trees above you. The air here
smells musty and you long for a fresh breath. You see an intersection of paths
to the west. The path you are on leads south into the darkening woods.

You continue on through darkness and gloom. The path below you has become a
wet quagmire. It is difficult to walk, and you make squishing sounds as you
move on. Looking east, you see a swampy path. The main path leads north and
south into darkness.

east.

The bloody intersection~
This is a small intersection. Paths lead east, west, and south. You are struck
by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

small boulders bounce and fall down below you. Looking to the east and west,

and it drops away to the north.

can be seen. Looking east, you see a small pass that will allow you to leave
the foothills. The foothills themselves extend to the south.

deeper into the foothills or to the west where a small pass will allow you to

Before the huge tree~
You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills
themselves are to the north. The edge of the hills leads to the east along the

stiff ocean wind has blown the rocks smooth here and you have to lean forward
a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
standing leads east and west along the shoreline.

The gathering place~
This appears to be the clearing the ogres use to assemble. It is quite large
and has a raised mound in the center that contains a crude throne. The ground
in front of the throne is quite worn, as if it is sat on quite often. You get
the impression that this place is a crude sort of auditorium. Small paths lead
east and south.

The firepit before the lodge~
You stand at the edge of a huge firepit. The heat from the burning embers
makes you sweat as you stand here. Large spits above the pit are empty but
they appear to be quite large enough to hold hapless adventurers. A large
lodge is towards the north, while paths lead east, west, and south into the
village itself.

village's refuse. Partially eaten corpses, rotting food, and other truly

with humanoid skulls sits against the west wall. A crude, blood stained altar
is against the east wall. A doorway is directly to the north, long strands of
beads blocking the view of the other side. Crude torches light the hall and 
smoke clings to the ceiling.

locks. The room is filled with trophies of dead enemies. It is quite lavishly
decorated for such a crude inhabitant as an ogre. A beaded doorway is to the
south.
