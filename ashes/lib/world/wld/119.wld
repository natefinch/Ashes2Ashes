Above the Mountain of Norn~
You are surrounded by a dark hazy mist as you begin to fly above the great
mountain of Norn and feel a chilling cold to your very bones as the wind
whips around you.

In the Air~
Surrounded by nothing but clouds you float and fly higher and higher until
even the great mountain of Norn is but a tiny spec on the plains of the frost
giants.

Further in the Air~
The Clouds surrounding you seem to gain substance and you hear the sound of
music coming from one just east of here.  Perhaps the birds voices are
stronger here where the wind whips you about like a feather, but that sounds
an awful like drums and not whistles.

an awful like drums and not whistles.
