Port of New Sparta~
        You stare in astonishment at the modern metropolis of New Sparta...
After examining the sky for a few minutes, you realize an old sailor has 
been staring at you the whole time.  As you gaze down at him, you notice
a strange aura around him.  When you finally decide to speak, the strange
sailor points to the city and says "With technology comes power and with
power comes DANGER!!"
        You turn to look back at the sailor and notice he is no longer 
there!  A feeling of hope and uneasiness pervades your body as you think 
about the city of New Sparta!

        As soon as you enter a large mob of salesmen with vendor carts rush

the modern technology and the sheer size of the buildings.  You are confident 
that this city is at least 1000 times better than Midgaard.
        To the east lies the Fishery.  The west leads to the Tin Can Alley, 
the economically challenged neighborhood (note the PC terminology).

This group of blondes, brunettes, and redheads is one of the most stunning
you've ever seen.  These are the best that New Sparta has to offer. It's

The End of the Concourse~
        As you come to the end of the concourse, you find the entrance
to the East Stands of WarDome--the SuperBoxes.  Unfortunately, you're
not permitted to go in as these are reserved for the very elite.  There
is a sign on the door to the SuperBoxes. 
        After getting over your disappointment (you always wanted to
see the inside of a SuperBox), you notice that someone has rather
carelessly left open the door to the Visitor's Locker room, just inviting
someone to walk in.
        The concourse runs west, to the north you may enter the locker-

for part of such a new building.  It seems doubtful that anyone actually

As you peer through what little light there is, you notice a loose grate
in the far corner.  Letting curiosity get the best of you, you lift
up the grate and find a long ladder descending into darkness.

Vile, sweaty, lewd, rude, crude, and usually drunk--this is not the

The Police Station~
	There are dozens of policemen franticly searching through various
tidbits of evidence looking for answers to all the killings and murders in
New Sparta.  Watch out, they might even have your name!
	Second Avenue is to the north, the Chief's office is to the south,
and the jail is to the west.

The Jersey Dump~
	This is the main dump, where everyone from anywhere throws their
trash, radioactive or otherwise.  Go ahead--fell free to dump here too, 
but don't stay too long 'cause the radiation can be fatal.
	Second Avenue runs east.

The Chief's Office~
	Here you are in the office of New Sparta's new Chief of Police,
Chief O'Hara, who just transferred from the Gotham Police Force.  His
office is neatly decorated with bat paraphranalia on one wall, and a 
fully stocked bar on the other.
	A door to the north leads to the rest of the station.

The Jail~
	You get the impression that more things go on in here than is
supposed to.  South of here is the actual jail cell, where most of
New Sparta's notorious criminals reside.  There are only two ways into
the cell--get the key off of the warden, or be convicted......
	The Police Station is to the east.

The Jail Cell~
	If you are in here, for your sake you had better have a key,
or you may rot here indefinitely, as the cell door is extremely hard
to open from the inside.  Oh, and just one word of advice--don't bend
over for the soap!

Entrance to Goethe's Garden~
	This is the entrance to Goethe's Garden, the public park
of New Sparta.  The park is named after the famous martyr and
generous donor of the land which New Sparta is built upon, Goethe.
	To the north is the Statue of Goethe, and to the south is
Broadway.

The Statue of Goethe~
	Much like the man, the very lifelike statue exudes an aura
of verbosity.  The Statue was constructed many years ago to honor
his genius and humanitarianism, and to his contribution to the
foundation of New Sparta.
	To the south is Goethe's Garden.

statue goethe~
You witness in front of yourself a monolith of manhood, a guru of
grandiosity a plethora of poetic prowess, an epitome of elegance, the
sultan of sonnets, the champion of chivalry, an embodyment of empathy,
and the zenith of... something.  It's Goethe!
 
The statue of Goethe looms before you.  He is mounted on his favorite
steed, the trusty Nessumsar.  As always the sweet essence of his poetry
is dripping off his tongue.  His all-knowing eyes seem to pierce 
through you.  You can't help but fell embarrassed about all your
shortcomings as you stand beside this solemn stud (not the horse
silly, the man-stud Goethe!).

First Avenue~
	You immediatly realize that the city suddenly grew darker 
when you left Broadway and it makes you feel uncomfortable.  You hear
the sounds of what you think is a war being raged off to the west and 
you wonder if it is safe to find out what's going on.
	The Intersection of First and Broadway is to the east and Hell's
Kitchen is to the west.

Entrance to Hell's Kitchen~
	As you walk in, you wonder why it is so dark here...and then
you realize either that the electric company is too afraid to come and
repair the lights or because the people here are too poor to afford lights.
You sense the tremendous evil that lurks within and decide that your 
personal safety is more important than exploring...besides you can think
of at least of a dozen better places you'd rather be than in Hell's 
Kitchen.
	You decide that the only real exit is to First Avenue which is 
to the east.

Welcome to New SpartaCON!~
You are standing within the New SpartaCON convention.  There is a single
dealer in the center of the room.  Obviously the zone writers want
you to go toward him (or just follow the single aisle ;])....
I bet you say to yourself, this is almost realistic there sheolio...
If this was realistic you would be studying, showering, eating, sleeping
or getting laid.  But, since mud is addicting, you will be spending the
rest of your days here with me and the gang...
Have fun and Die well
Sheol (Matt Dragon 1/23/96)
