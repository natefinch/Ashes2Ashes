Hallway in a office building~
As you continue down the hallway you notice two doors here...one labeled
Dr. Scratchinsniff, local psychiatrist.  The other is labeled 'Nurse'.
This is not the time you think for a mental examination, you have broke
into a movie studio, are galavanting around snooping through studios, and
now you want to have your life story made into a movie...your perfectly sane!

Dr. Scratchinsniff's Office~
You walk into the office looking for the good doctor, when instead you see
his couch and a nice comfy pillow on it, you can't resist!  As you lay back
and stretch out and enjoy the couch a voice from behind you says 'So! How
are you feeling today??' That has got to be the worst accent you have ever
heard!!  You begin to look for the exit before you have to kill him to get
him to shut up!!!

Nurse's Station~
You look around in this almost blinding white room.  This is the brightest
room you have ever seen it is almost to much until your eyes start to adjust,
that's when you notice the "hardware" of the typical nurse, you see the
degree on the wall and the obvious qualifications of the nurse on staff!
You hear a voice call from behind the door saying "Remove your clothes, I'll
be with you in a moment"  The voice was female...you get a little jittery
and look for the exit!

at last you have found what you have been seeking here.  You give a faint
knock, no reply, you knock again, nothing.  You wonder if anyone is even in
there, and so you decide to peep your head in the door to see!!

Spielberg is here wondering what you want with him.  He looks over something
and you see a script in the corner that has dust and must not have made it
past the stage it is at right now...it looks to be labeled E.T. 2!!!
You better make it quick, he looks to be very busy!

is directly to the north.  You can also see the Acme Labs to the west and
a road leading back behind the studios.  Where it goes there is only one
way to find out.

Brothers symbol painted on it way at the top you can see a wheel that
when turned looks like it could open the entire tower up!
There is a rusty ladder that goes up the tower and you can see it goes to the
very top, so if your feeling adventurous go for it!

studios and all the people running around and you see that pudgy little
guard that you snuck by to get into the studio!  UT OH!! He sees you too!!
You better hurry up and get down before he gets some friends and comes
and removes you the hard way!

wind is picking up at this altitude!  You wonder what you will find up here
or maybe you can at least get a good vantage point to see the entire land!
You see the opening of the floor of the tower right above you, or you can
climb your way back down!

and see the beginning and end of the day here.  It is a magnificent view, you
wonder why no one else ever comes up here to enjoy the view.  You then see
the wheel that once you turn the tower may be opened...you fear what may be
inside, maybe it DOES still contain water, who knows, turn it and see!

Back Road~
A back road around the back of the studio is what you find, you wonder what
could live out in these back woods, but you figure something will present
itself and if you have to you can defend yourself.  You pat your weapon just
to check it is still there.

Unfortunately the owner of this tree does not share its happy attitude!
You poor soul, you have stumbled upon the home of the crankiest of creatures
in the whole wide world, this is the home of Slappy Squirrel, a one time
famous cartoon star, now a old, cranky squirrel, she also lives with

in the yard and a dog watching the little girl carefully.  The gate appears
to be all that is holding the kid in, she is tearing around chasing butterflies

A side room from the tournament~
A shadow filled back hallway that seems to denote trouble around the bend and
if the competition in the ring is any indication maybe you would be best to
leave this area.  You hear someone laughing manically seemingly from all
sides that sends a shiver to the bone.  The walls seem to close in on you and
you feel very claustrophobic all of the sudden.  You hate the fear and you
want to find what is causing it and you see it...In the shadows to the right
you see a IMMENSE human being in a full coat of armor and giving off enough
energy and ki to make your hair stand on end.  He speaks to you, "Are you
Terry Bogard?"  You calmly state that you are not and he then says too bad
and says, "Entertain me" you fear his kind of entertainment!  Someone shouts
Krauser you are a fool leave these piddly insignificants alone and go find
Bogard!  At this the man in the shadows says to you, "Another time then."
You feel relieved.

Geese Howard's Office~
A huge spacious office with a nice window overlooking the King of the Fighters
tournament going on at this moment.  You look around and see that Geese is
a man of taste and has a large oak desk with a couple bookcases and a hidden
compartment in his desk springs open and scares you.  You look inside to see
a scroll wrapped up and as you unravel it to look at it, Geese
is upon you demanding you to join his cause as you must be good to get by
Krauser.  He doesn't like no by the way.  He cackles maniacally at your
refusal to join him and it seems to echo all over, now you know where that
came from earlier.  You feel humble before this great warrior who only seeks
to gain revenge on Terry Bogard for defeating him and placing the huge
scar on his chest as a permenent reminder of his loss.

As you strain to see around you as the dark just seems to swallow every bit
of light like a shark swallows a fish whole.  You notice a odd little hole
placed on a pedastal here.  It looks to be about the size of a retangular
object.  You wonder what it opens, but since you have not found what could
possibly go there you just look around for another exit.

A hidden room~
A hidden room found only by using the necklace that Sulia carries around her
neck at all times.  It is where the story of her lineage is told and where the
mystical Armor of Mars and it's power is explained by the pictures on the
wall.  The pictures also demonstrate how the origins of both Terry and Andy's
fighting style began.  As well as Krauser's!  This explains why he
was so powerful, he was spawned in a lineage that had the Armor of Mars.
It is said that whoever controls all six pieces is the most powerful
human living and if you are a direct decendent of Goddemaus himself as
Laocorn and Sulia are, you will become a GOD.  There is one minor thing though
while you are staring at the pictures the guardians of the room are here.
They do not seem impressed by your being this close to their master.

Deeper in the hidden room~
As you stroll around looking at the other pictures in the room you notice the
detail and the storyline unfold more.  It shows Goddemaus ransacking villages
left and right being a immense ruler of the roman times and eventually 
causing the fall of the roman empire because he defeated Alexander to a
point that he never recovered and started the vicious downward spiral.
The power Goddemaus showed was unstoppable *CRACK* you turn and see someone
sitting indian style on the floor looking up at you.  He does not appear
pleased with you here, and looks to be the guardian of the room.  He is
taller if nto as tall as Krauser and seems to send out waves of energy
from the ground up.  You hope he is not the kind who shoots and asks questions
later.  He stands up and assumes a stance and attacks you full force!

The chamber of the map~
This is the room with the map of where all the pieces to the Armor of Mars
was buried, that's right, WAS.  It seems Laocorn has succeeded in attaining
all 6 pieces of the armor and he now plans to dominate the world.  You hope
your group is tough enough to stop him because he does not seem impressed
with your puny attacks and the fact your mortal flesh can only do so much.
He has surpassed humanity and become a GOD and now it appears you will be
the first to know what it feels like to have one beat you into a bloody
mess because here he comes!

accompanied by a wierd looking bird creature with pointy wings that make
you wonder how the thing flies by itself, lil alone with a saddle on it's
back for the rider.

Another form of tournament~
Another tournament is being held here much like the King of Fighters version
but this one is involving all races of creatures from all over the galaxy.
It appears the contest has been narrowed down to two contestants and they
would not appriciate you interrupting them.  There is a square ring with 
a dragon looking female at one end and a short lil pointy eared demon at
the other.  They appear to mean business but if you know this anime show
you know it will not be without it's humor as well.
