The head-control room~
As you step into this dim-lit room, the door behind you automatically
closes.  A red-light next to this room is flashing as though you have
trigger an alarm of some sort.  There's a man here working hard to maintain
the primary functions on this starship and he seems to be too busy to
notice your presence.  He's dressed in a green armor that looks thicker
than any space suit you've seen.  The man looks like a very intelligent 
person because of how he handles the controls as though he knows
immediately what each button will do.  He doesn't look tough but who knows
what weapons he has in that high-tech battle armor he's wearing.

The DC booth~
Welcome to the DC booth at the comic convention.  Standing behind the booth
is a young woman nearly naked.  She is signing autgraphs as she is portraying
some comic heroin.  There is a geek sitting to the right, he has a stained
white t shirt and is loving the young lady.  He looks up to you and says
'Can I help you?'

Inside a teleporter room~
You appear out of nowhere in a room you've never seen before!  Everywhere you
look, you can see control panels and flashing lights flickering on and off.
It seems you've been teleported to a starship of some sort or maybe a space
station...but you're not certain.  There are large windows all around the
walls that surround you, and the only things that seem to be out there are
stars, comets, and a large meteor storm.  To your north, there's a door
that'll take you to a hallway.

passengers aboard this vessel were soldiers who slept in bunks with other
soldiers.  There are beds everywhere in this section lining the walls all the
way to the west of here.

A large, round meteor is located here and it's not in motion...someone or
something seems to be riding on top of it.  It looks like one of those
super-characters you would find on Earth but something tells you he's not
from your home-world.  This being looks magnificent and frightening at the
same time.  With pointy ears and a dark, evil face, he stares and laughs at
you as though he is about to do something WICKED!

You should have never stepped into this place.  No mortal should ever witness
two of the greatest, most powerful beings in the universe challenging one
another for the fate of REALITY!  You're standing before two celestial beings
that are about to engage in a combat that would shatter worlds light-years
away.  At this moment, they seem to be discussing time barriers, alternate
universes, and such things that are beyond any human comprehension. This
would be a good time for you to leave before their grand battle starts...

Meteors and more meteors are passing you by at an incredible speed and it's
becoming more difficult to dodge them as you continue your long journey. You
notice a man coming close to your direction.  He doesn't look hostile and
maybe he's just trying to help you out of this stellar deathtrap.  But can
you trust a green-skinned, bald-headed man who's wearing nothing but blue
underwear and cape?

could save you.  You can feel the intense heat of this rock as it sears your
skin, charring it to the BONE!  The torture doesn't end there...the meteor
seems to be dragging you along on its journey and before you could close your
eyes, you notice you're about to be slammed into another meteor!!  Sorry,

Dodging through this meteor storm is becoming more difficult as you advance
closer to your destination, wherever that may be...  Suddenly, you notice a
man on a motorcylce-like space cruiser coming towards your direction.  He
doesn't look like a nice guy...in fact he's about to run you over...either
because you're in his way or he's a homicidal maniac who enjoys watching
people DIE and SUFFER!

At a distance from where you're standing, you can see a small, lovely blue
planet.  You wanted to go there for a visit but there are two super-beings
here preventing anyone from disturbing the planet's serenity.  One of them is
wearing a green vest with oversized boots and the other is a smaller
gentleman with blue skin.  Both of them seem to be talking before you wander
to this area, and they don't seem happy about your presence here. The two
beings don't look hostile but if you try anything funny, they could really
mess you up.

seen before.  The alien technology is unimaginable and the construction and
the architecture is just awe-inspiring.  This castle is made of solid metal
of unknown composition and it looks sturdy enough to withstand an attack even
from a galactic armada.

north of here and into the throne room.  He does look like a pretty tough
guy, maybe you should think about turning back right now... To the north, a

for the Lord Darkseid is one of the most powerful and cunning beings in this
entire universe!

The Throne Room of Lord Darkseid~
Just as soon as you enter this majestic room, the door behind you closes all
of a sudden!  You have nowhere to go...either challenge the great Darkseid in
mortal combat or DIE!  As you look around, the center platform you're
standing on begins to rise quickly.  You look over the edge to see what's
below and you gasp in fear...large bone-grinding blades are placed there to
dispose of fools who think they can defeat a GOD.  On the throne, Darkseid
looks at you and laughs out loud.  You can feel the power that surrounds this
mighty tyrant, and he seems to be ready to ANNIHILATE you with his SUPREME
deathblows!

devour your body with ease, and your screams of agony echo throughout this
room as Darkseid laughs with amusement!  You begin to choke on your own
blood as you struggle in pain to free yourself from this grisly deathtrap!
Sorry, young space-traveler, your long journey has finally come to an end.

Eastern-section hallway~
Finally, it looks like you've come to the end of this long hallway.  There
are new passageways that you can take here.  To your northeast, a room is
located there...it looks like the engineering room of this starship but
you're not sure.  To your west, another section of the hallway begins...it
looks like it will lead you towards the midsection of the vessel.

It looks like this short hallway ends here.  There's a large room northwest
of where you're standing and you are in awe to see all the monitors,
diagrams, maps, etc. on all the walls and computer consoles.  There's a large
table in the center of this room and chairs are lined to the sides of it.
That room must be some sort of a meeting place for the crew of this great
starship.

this huge room.  This must be the engineering room where the ship recieves
and regenerates its power supply.  This is a very well-lit room, the lights
on the power cells are so bright, it could almost make you blind when you
look at it.

cells are making the room so bright that you have to shield your eyes from

There's a big guy sitting on a chair motionless as though he's dead.  Maybe

skin is sitting here, looking as though he's been dead for a year.  Watch

chairs are lined all around it.  Monitors and schematic charts are everywhere
on the walls and control consoles.  A man with a fish tank for a helmet seems
to be controlling this section of the room.  He's configuring some data on
the main control panel.

and his large, round head is unlike any human on earth.  This little elf

starship or its head control room.

storm's pathway.  A man is here laughing out loud as though he is amused by
the life and death situation that he's about to face.  He looks like a
circus clown because of the makeup on his face and his colorful outfit.
Behind teh large screen monitor is a pathway that'll take you north of this
starship...it might lead you towards the head control room.

this starship under control.  Watch Out!  Once you pass through into that
room, the security system in this vessel may be activitated immediately and
you may find yourself at the mercy of this bloodthirsty crew.

towering everywhere.  There are people walking here and there ... it's like
Tokyo Main Street during business hours.  The noise level in this city is so
loud that your ear drums feel like it's about to burst.  But it's not the
people nor the noise that makes this city so different from New York or any
other metropolitan area, it's the super- beings that are roaming freely here.
Some of these superbeings look dangerous and others look majestic in their
pose as they fly over this futuristic city. There's a small sign posted here.

sign post board~
In the year 1998, a devasting earthquake rocked the continent of North
America.  Hundreds of millions died and all of the cities were in ruins.
Looters, scavengers, and murderers were left free to do whatever they wished
and there were no one to stop them.  The US government was losing control
over its armies as they were tempted themselves to start raping cities for
food and other valuables.  The situation became so bad that the superheroes
planned a truce with their super-nemesis to help rebuild America and to
restore a new government controlled by both parties.  It was an unlikely
alliance but amazingly the plan worked out well.  Metro-Gotham is now the
largest city in the world, covering almost half of North America.  The name
'Metro-Gotham' was given to this city in honor of the two great cities,
Metropolis and Gotham, which were destroyed instantly by the earthquake.

The Metro-Gotham Subway Transit~
The subway system of this large city is very complex and it'll take some time
before you'll be able to find your way around.  There's a marble stairway
ahead of where you're standing and from here, you can see vacationers and
businessmen/women pacing quickly down the steps trying to catch the earliest
train.  You can hear the loud speakers as the ticketeer announce the
destination routes and arrival times.

It's so crowded in here that you're beginning to sweat profusely.  Everyone
is lining up to get onto the next train and they all seem to be very anxious
as one person pushes another.  There's no place to breathe in here and you

station doesn't help you very much either.  The sunlight from the other side

you'll notice the clam area of this Black Hole continues there.

A Black Hole...!~
Just as you enter this area of the Black Hole, a monster -- the size of 5
normal men -- is here, standing before you with closed fist.  Parts of his
massive body are covered in stone and his knuckles are studded with razor-
sharp edges.  His eyes are bloody red as though they are filled with rage and
anger for vengeance!  Don't get too close to him...if you annoy him, he can
hurl you back to the turbulence of the outer section of this Black Hole!

A Black Hole...!~

     AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  THE PAIN!!!!

The force of the Black Hole rocks you back and forth...you are in pain
as the pressure inside this area pounds your head!  Blood begins to flow
down from your nose and you begin to lose consciousness.  As you look 
around inside this massive darkness, you'll notice that there seems to be
no way out of here.  You cry out for help but the void of space muffles any
sounds that you make...  Sorry, young traveler, entering this area of space
may be the biggest mistake you have ever made!

The Front Garden of Wayne Manor~
The mansion in front of you is just incredible.  It must be hundreds of years
old and yet it looks so well-kept.  The owners of this large mansion must
have spent millions on maintenance and repair.  As you step closer to the
large mansion doors, you'll notice a lovely decorative fountain.  The mansion
doors are located east of where you're standing.

You are now inside the mansion of one of the world's most richest men.  As
you step inside this room, you are in awe to see so many Picassos, Monets,
and various other valuable paintings hanging on the wall as though they serve
as wallpaper.  The insides of this magnificent structure is as beautiful as
its outsides and you are curious to go from room to room to study its
historical architecture.

aisle.  Bruce Wayne must have spent a fortune buying all these treasures just
so he can enjoy them for himself.  The main hallway continues north and south

you to the den where Bruce Wayne and his young ward, Dick Grayson, spend
their time reading books.

There are shelves and shelves of books everywhere you look!  You are amazed
by the size of this den, it looks much larger than the local library that you
go to.  The books on each shelves are all original prints and are leather
bounded to keep from deterioration.  You wish you had the time to go look
through each shelf to find your favorite book but you know that Alfred the
butler wants you out as soon as you are done with your touring.

further inside this den, you'll notice a warm fireplace is located to the end
of here.  There are a couple of 'lazy boys' beside the fireplace where Bruce
Wayne and his young friend, Dick Grayson, would sit down to relax and read a
good book.  As you head towards those chairs to lie down, you'll notice a
book shelf to the south of here.  There seems to be a light coming from
behind it...could it be a secret passage?

You hesitate for a second before you start walking inside this dark, secret
passageway.  You don't know what could be lurking ahead and you're not sure
you even want to find out.  However your cowardice has been overcome by your
greed...the thought of a hidden treasure inside this two-hundred year  old
mansion makes you the bravest of men.  As you continue your walk inside this
tunnel, you'll notice that bats high above you are making a loud shrieking
noise as though they are trying to warn someone of your presence.

hideout and the info-center of Batman!  So if the Batcave is located under
the Wayne Mansion, what's the connection between Bruce Wayne and the
mysterious vigilante?...guess you'll never know...  A tall, steel door from
the south of here is blocking your way into the Batcave.

world.  As you walk further inside this secret hideout, you'll notice a glass
display case.  Inside that case, the Batman keeps his extra suit just in case
his old one got soiled.  Just when you thought you're alone in here, you hear
a sound coming from the west of here...  It's probably the Batman discussing
his strategies with his sidekick, Robin!

nothing escapes them from solving this case.  To the south of here, you'll

Gotham!  But the criminals don't seem to be interested to getting out at this

group and make sure that everyone knows their priorities.  There's a large
table in the middle of this room and there are twelve seats that surround it.
On the wall in front of you, there's a giant main viewer where the members
can see satellite images of what's happening around the world.  To the north

Inside the Titan's Tower~
You're amazed, bedazzled, and shocked by the incredible beauty of this lavish
building.  You wonder who could be living inside this amazing glass castle
with such wealth and taste.  To the north of here, you'll notice a small
pathway that'll take you to a glass elevator.  That elevator would take you
to the upper floors of this grand palace.

As soon as you walk into this room, a security guard jumps up from his seat
and shouts at you to halt.  He doesn't look too friendly and he doesn't look
like he's going to do you any favors.  The elevator looks to be locked tight
and the only way you can get inside is to get the key from this husky guard.

inside this elevator all day just to check out the outdoor view.  You'll

directly upwards to the main suite of this building.

You are in awe to see such a lovely decorated room.  The floor is covered in
white marble tiles and the walls are plastered with pastel-colored paint.
This spacious room is very well-lit and the sunroof is providing most of the
warmth that makes this room so cozy.  There's a large screen projection
television located in the middle of the room with leathery couches
surrounding it.  This room makes you feel as though you're home at this very
moment.  To the east and west, you can see there are rooms connecting to this
one.

one another.  There are tables here set up so that they can watch the indoor
view while enjoying a light snack.  The bar is located just next to you where
they can select from various types of drinks.  The large fridge just in front
of you seems to be packed with food and there's a hot chef stove ready to
cook a hearty meal.

As you walk inside this room, you'll notice that there are large computers
from wall to wall.  This looks like a meeting room of some sort.  There's a
large table in the center of the room and there are about a dozen chairs
surrounding it.  There's a large view screen in front of the meeting table
where occupants can watch during a discussion.  To the north, there's a force
field of some sort that blocks you from going to that direction.  It looks
impenetrable and the only way to open it is to get a security combo.

This section of the corridor is as empty as the one you came from.  The only

This restricted corridor looks like it may take some time before anyone can
reach the end.  The different combos that are required to open each
forcefield is beginning to confuse you.  The strategy of the Teen Titans is
working pretty well...instead of one member having all the keys, they would
spread them all out to its members, that way the intruder would give up
instead of trying to go any further.

You're just drifting inside this 'nothingness' and there doesn't seem to be
anywhere you can go to.  The door from which you have entered from seems to
be still opened.  Maybe it would be wise if you go back before you get
trapped inside this strange place.  As you reach for the door, you notice a
new doorway is opening before your very eyes.  A magical portal appears in

This room is not so well-lit but you can see the silhouettes of soldiers
standing beside a larger being, possibly the leader of the pack.  The giant
is way too big to be anything human and the reindeer horns growing from his
head makes him look like the Devil himself.  His eyes are glowing red and he

hot-dog stands seem like they're rolling in the big bucks.  As you walk
further northeast of here, you'll notice more and more trees are planted
here.  There are shrubbery and flower gardens everywhere you look.  There has
to be a park somewhere around this vicinity.

their frisbees or flying kites.  Meanwhile the adults there are cooling

here for relaxation and some fun with the kids.  The children here are
running back and forth throwing frisbees to one another and others are riding
on bikes and skating on roller blades.  Everyone seems to be enjoying
themselves on this nice sunny day.

You wonder why they don't set their picnic spot around here where the grass
is greener and fresher.  Maybe it's because of the lack of security in this
park since gang members have been reported to attack any tourists they came
across.  The overhead lights and the hidden security cameras don't do a whole
lot to solve this problem.

You're standing before the largest castle you've ever seen.  Amazingly it
looks very well-maintained as though it was built just yesterday.  The
drawbridge is just east of here and it looks like it's locked.  The moat of
this castle seems to be inhabited by some serpentine creatures so there's no
way you can get inside without having to open the wooden drawbridge.  As
darkness begins to fall, you know it's time to run before the creatures of
the night catches up to you...

Even though this place looks very well decorated and well-maintained, you
still think there's something strange about this castle.  You sense that this
castle is more that what it seems, that it's 'unreal,' almost like a dream.
You don't understand why you would think that...but something in your head
tells you that you're not fully conscious about your surroundings. The idea
that everything in here are figments of your dream is beginning to confuse
you, the only way to escape this madness is to walk out of here.

The Room of the Gathering~
Everything inside this room looks so blurry, so unreal.  In a dream, nothing
is clear in the unconscious mind.  The only figures you can make out are the
six mysterious beings sitting around an octagon-shaped table. They don't seem
to be moving their lips as they try to communicate with you...but your mind
is not focused enough to understand their words.  You become confused and you
want to get out of here.  The only way out of this castle seems to be that
door north of here.

This is the only exit out of this room.  Use it wisely...

A Deep, Dark Wooded Area~
It only gets darker and darker as you move deeper and deeper into this
heavily wooded area.  The thick canopy shields out any sunlight that could
help you find your way around here.  You bump from one tree to another and
you trip on tree roots and vines as you struggle to move as quickly as
possible through the thick woods.

Inside the Daily Planet~
As you step inside this historical building, you'll notice the workers here
are scrambling back and forth trying to meet the deadline.  You can hear the
typewriters and the shoutings from the halls as the reporters and writers are
all going crazy trying to complete their tasks.  As you move further inside
this massive structure, you can see a marble staircase that'll take you to
the upperfloors.

Inside the Daily Planet~
You've reached the second floor of this building after climbing that long
staircase.  This floor is no different from the previous floor you came from.
Workers here are still scrambling to get their work done before the end of
the day.

Inside the Daily Planet~
This floor doesn't seem to be as crowded as the previous floors you came
from.  You can guess that this must be the floor where the management staff
has their offices set up.  There's a man here, standing in the distance and
smoking a cigar.  He looks pretty important...he must be the chief editor of
the Daily Planet...

Walking along a curved section of Golden Age Avenue~
The scenaries along this section of the road are just magnificent.  The fresh
sea breeze and the sound of sea gulls on the beach make you just wish you can
live around this neighborhood.  This curved section of the road seems to take
you further along the shoreline.

Walking on Golden Age Avenue~
You can never get tired of walking along this beautiful roadway.  The
picturesque landscapes are so natural and the vast sea that spans as far as
the eye can see is just breathtaking.  You'll notice you're coming close to
the end of this long road.  It seems to end close to that large mansion from
a distance, east of here.

End of Golden Age Avenue~
This long stretch of road ends here and you're not surprise where it took
you.  You're standing before a driveway garden of one of the richest men on
the planet...Bruce Wayne.  Yes, Bruce Wayne, the billionaire playboy-
philanthropist lives inside this huge mansion.  The driveway garden that's
structured in front of the mansion is just lovely.  You're tempted to walk
around this estate to examine the Victorian-style mansion and maybe even
catch a glimpse of the popular Mr. Wayne through the windows.
