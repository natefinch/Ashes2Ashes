Castle, evidently built not so much for strength as for beauty.
It is not totally without defences, though, for it is surrounded
by a deep moat, and its windows are just narrow slits for archers
to shoot through. To the north there is a drawbridge across the moat.

guests are housed. To the east there is a large, ornamented

The Guest Suite~
   This must be where only the most highly regarded guests stay, since
it is luxurious beyond your wildest imagination. This is only the living
room of the suite, but it is huge and tastefully decorated. All the 
furniture is not only beautiful, but also made for comfort. To the 
north, there is an exit to the bedroom, and there is a door to the west.

A Guest Room~
   You are standing in a large room. Although it is comfortable enough,
you can tell it is not meant for any of the most illustrious guests,

massive bookshelves, filled with all kinds of books. The titles include
works such as: 'A Treatise on the History of Midgaard and surrounding
areas', 'Magic - A Beginner's Introduction' and many others. There is
an exit to the west.

The Top of the Tower~
   You have arrived at the top of the tower. This tower is pretty
uninteresting, and seems made purely for reasons of defence and 
guarding. The windows are slits for bowmen, very narrow on the 
outward side and broad inwards to allow a wide shooting angle.
The only evident exit is down the stairs again.

The Top of the Tower~
   This is the highest of all the towers, and is obviously used for
lookout purposes. The view is splendid in all four directions. All
around you, the rich countryside spreads out to the horizon. To the 
north and east you see a vast mountain range, and far to the west
a beautiful lake. A bit closer, the town of Midgaard lies at the
end of the King's Road. The only exit you can see is down again.

To the north, the tall White Mountains have their highest peaks.

plains. The sight of those high, far mountains fills you with a

away, you can glimpse something silvery that has to be the Sea.
