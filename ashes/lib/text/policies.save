The Administration 

===============================================================

Worlds of Destiny POLICY:

These are the rules enforced on Worlds of Destiny:

HARRASSMENT:
 Harrassment exists in many forms and WILL NOT be tolerated at WoD. We 
have many ways to determine if you are guilty of harrassing your fellow 
players, but we prefer not to have to worry about it at all. Harrassment 
consists of, but it not limited to, the following kinds of behaviors:
 1. Following someone around who has already told you not to follow them.
 2. Verbal abuse over either TELL channel or any other PUBLIC channels.
 3. Sexual advances towards someone who has already declined your actions.
 4. Moving someone around the MUD, by teleporting or summoning or 
    recalling, without their permission.
 5. For IMMs, it also includes switching into MOBs and preforming any 
    type of harrassment to another character.
Harrassment IS A FREEZING OFFENSE. It has happened before, and we would 
really rather that it not have to happen again. Please report any 
complaints about harrassment to the first immortal you see.

PLAYER KILLING:
 Right now, you should not be able to kill another player unless both of 
you have the assassin flag.  

ASSASSINS:
  Assasins are characters who are permitted to player kill other characters
with the assassin's flag.  Be sure you read help assassin before you 
decide to become one.  Once you have decided to become an assassin, you
will remain an assassin.  You will find all the information you need is 
under help assassin.  If you request assassin we assume you know what 
you are asking for.

PLAYER STEALING:
 It is illegal to steal from another player.  If you are found stealing 
from another player you will be told to return the item and your 
character may be frozen.  It is also illegal to take items from a corpse 
which you did not kill, this is called kill stealing.

PLAYER CORPSE LOOTING:
 It is illegal to loot a players corpse unless the owner of the corpse has
asked you to retrieve it and/or its equipment.  Otherwise, you MUST wait
for the corpse to disintegrate.  Equipment laying on the ground is fair
game, but use common sense.  If there is another player standing in the
room, ask if it is their's first.  Summoning or charming a monster to
devour the corpse is illegal and we will approach it as player 
stealing.  Picking up the corpse and holding it in your inventory or a 
charmed mobs's inventory is also player stealing (see above).

BUGS:
 Please report any and all bugs that you find, or anything that you think 
MIGHT be a bug, to an IMM.  If you fail to do so and use this bug to your 
own advantage, you WILL be frozen.  Crash bugs should be reported to the 
highest level immort on at the time.  If we find you using a bug to crash 
the mud all your char's will be immediately frozen and you may be banned 
from WoD.

REIMBURSEMENT:
 Reimbs ARE NOT granted on reboots or planned crashes, that is tuff
Reimbs will be granted based on the IMMORTALS descretion. See the 
help file on REIMB for further information.  Reimbs will not be granted if 
it is only a few items, this is called a partial reimb.  These will never
be done by an immort so please do not even bother asking.  If we find out 
you lied about a reimb, this will result in the loss of your char.

MULTI-PLAYING:
 You are allowed to have up to 2 mortal characters playing online at the
same time.  Under NO circumstances are you allowed to have an IMM and a
mort on at the same time. Even if one or both are linkdead.  If you are 
caught with an immort and a mort on at the same time you will be warned 
the first time.  The second time is a freezeable offense.
  You can NOT have more than two 'bodies' in the game at once -
        THIS INCLUDES ALL LINKDEAD CHARS
  To state this more clearly, if you have 2 chars on, you want another
for whatever reason - one has got to go.  This includes characters at
the menu screen, or characters you are rolling.  You can only have
two characters in the game IN ANY FORM.

SELF-DELETING:  
 Doing this for the purpose of getting better stats is illegal and 
punishable by the freezing of the mort because you were given a chance to
keep, or not keep, your stats in character generation.  If you made a 
mistake in creating your character (i.e. wrong name, sex, class), ask an
ASST+ to change it for you.  This will be handled on a case to case basis.

USING GOSSIP, ASSASSIN, MUSIC AND AUCTION CHANNELS:
 Please use them for what they are each intended (i.e. don't spam
players on the gossip channel with your favorite songs, etc).  Also,
please use tact and don't use your repeat key (!) on these channels to
scroll everyone to death.  If you do this, you WILL be warned, if you
continue, you will be muted and unable to use these channels for at least 
24 hours.  Continued abuse of channels by scrolling could result in freezing.

SWEARING, ETC: 
 We don't mind swearing, hell we do it ourselves all the damn time.  :)
We only ask that you don't get carried away with it and don't get TOO
graphic.  There are real life ladies online, and some players are very
young, so again, use common sense.  If you are asked to stop, please
stop.

IMMORTING:
 Immorting is currently done done by e-mail application to Daxx at 
xanthian@marsweb.com (DO NOT mudmail Daxx or anyone else). Only after 
you have enough experience to reach level 101 will any application be 
considered.  Type 'help immorting' for more details on what to send to Daxx.

NODELETE 
 Because of th 
PROMOTIONS (IMM ONLY):
 Promotions will be given  to immorts that work Promos will
be granted on hard work, nothing else. In general, to those that really deserve it.  Promtions can be 
recommended by any immort for any level.  All recommendations should go to Daxx at 
xanthian@marsweb.com.

    
Punishment for breaking the rules include:

     First offence:  Warning.
     Second offence: Frozen for permenately or temporarily based on the 
                     decision of the justice deparetment.

These punishments are merely guidelines and might be different depending 
on the severity of the problem.

You are all capable of using common sense.  If you don't know, ask an immortal.

Urgent business can be mailed to Wod@pickle.dfwmm.net.
