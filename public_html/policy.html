    <P>These are the rules enforced on Ashes
      to Ashes:<BR><BR> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">HARASSMENT:</FONT></B>
      Harassment exists in many forms and WILL NOT be tolerated at Ashes. We
      have many ways to determine if you are guilty of harassing your fellow
      players, but we prefer not to have to worry about it at all. Harassment
      consists of, but it not limited to, the following kinds of behaviors: 1.
      Following someone around who has already told you not to follow them. 2.
      Verbal abuse over either TELL channel or any other PUBLIC channels. 3.
      Sexual advances towards someone who has already declined your actions. 4.
      Moving someone around the MUD, by teleporting or summoning or recalling,
      without their permission. 5. For IMMs, it also includes switching into
      MOBs and preforming any type of harassment to another character.
      Harassment IS A FREEZING OFFENSE. It has happened before, and we would
      really rather that it not have to happen again. Please report any
      complaints about harassment to the first immortal you see. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PLAYER
      KILLING:</FONT></B> Right now, you should not be able to kill another
      player unless both of you have the assassin flag.<BR><BR> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">ASSASSINS:</FONT></B>
      Assassins are characters who are permitted to player kill other characters
      with the assassin's flag. Be sure you read help assassin before you decide
      to become one. Once you have decided to become an assassin, you will
      remain an assassin. You will find all the information you need is under
      help assassin. If you request assassin we assume you know what you are
      asking for. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PLAYER STEALING:</FONT></B>
      It is illegal to steal from another player. If you are found stealing from
      another player you will be told to return the item and your character may
      be frozen. It is also illegal to take items from a corpse which you did
      not kill, this is called kill stealing. It is also illegal to attack a mob
      that another player is fighting or preparing to fight without their
      permision.<BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PLAYER
      CORPSE LOOTING:</FONT></B> It is illegal to loot a players corpse unless
      the owner of the corpse has asked you to retrieve it and/or its equipment.
      Otherwise, you MUST wait for the corpse to disintegrate. Equipment laying
      on the ground is fair game, but use common sense. If there is another
      player standing in the room, ask if it is theirs first. Summoning or
      charming a monster to devour the corpse is illegal and we will approach it
      as player stealing. Picking up the corpse and holding it in your inventory
      or a charmed mob's inventory is also player stealing (see above). <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">BUGS:</FONT></B>
      Please report any and all bugs that you find, or anything that you think
      MIGHT be a bug, to an IMM. If you fail to do so and use this bug to your
      own advantage, you WILL be frozen. Crash bugs should be reported to the
      highest level immortal on at the time. If we find you using a bug to crash
      the mud all your characters will be immediately frozen and you may be banned
      from Ashes.<BR><BR> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">FAILSAFES</FONT></B>
      There are certain failsafes in the game to keep people from having
      problems such as dying because their isp goes down. If you find a way to
      take advantage of a failsafe to benefit yourself, this is the same as
      taking advantage of a bug and is freezable. This includes losing link to
      avoid dying. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">REIMBURSEMENT: </FONT></B>Reimbs
      ARE NOT granted on scheduled reboots. Reimbs will be
      granted based on the IMMORTALS discretion. See the help file on REIMB for
      further information. Reimbs will not be granted if it is only a few items,
      this is called a partial reimb. These will never be done by an immort so
      please do not even bother asking. If we find out you lied about a reimb,
      this will result in the loss of your character. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">MULTI-PLAYING:</FONT></B>
      You are allowed to have up to 2 mortal characters playing online at the
      same time. Under NO circumstances are you allowed to have an IMM and a
      mort on at the same time. Even if one or both are linkdead. If you are
      caught with an immort and a mort on at the same time you will be warned
      the first time. The second time is a freezeable offense. You can NOT have
      more than two 'bodies' in the game at once - THIS INCLUDES ALL LINKDEAD
      CHARS To state this more clearly, if you have 2 chars on, you want another
      for whatever reason - one has got to go. This includes characters at the
      menu screen, or characters you are rolling. You can only have two
      characters in the game IN ANY FORM. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">SELF-DELETING:
      </FONT></B>It is alright to delete and recreate when the need arizes
      however, do not repeatedly delete and recreate over and over. There
      is no reason for it, and it tends to be annoying to imms.<BR><BR>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">USING GOSSIP, ASSASSIN, MUSIC AND AUCTION
      CHANNELS:</FONT></B> Please use them for what they are each intended (i.e.
      don't spam players on the gossip channel with your favorite songs, etc).
      Also, please use tact and don't use your repeat key (!) on these channels
      to scroll everyone to death. If you do this, you WILL be warned, if you
      continue, you will be muted and unable to use these channels for at least
      24 hours. Continued abuse of channels by scrolling could result in
      freezing. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">SWEARING, ETC:</FONT></B>
      We don't mind swearing, hell we do it ourselves all the damn time. :) We
      only ask that you don't get carried away with it and don't get TOO
      graphic. There are real life ladies online, and some players are very
      young, so again, use common sense. If you are asked to stop, please stop.
      <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">IMMORTING:</FONT> </B>Immorting is
      currently done done by e-mail. Once you reach level 100 you can
      <A HREF="mailto:jjster01@homer.louisville.edu">e-mail Sarnoth</A> to apply for immorting.
      Type 'help immorting' for more details on
      what to send. <BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">NODELETE: </FONT></B>Nodelete
      is a flag to protect mortals from the maintenance program. It will be
      given to anyone who needs it because they will be unable to log on
      for a long time, such as for vacations. Please ask an imm in the mortal
      affairs department about this if you need it. This flag is also
      allowed for the Administration and Assistants of the Administration
      because they are expected to spend most of their time immortal. </P>
    
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Punishment for breaking the rules include:</FONT></B>
      <BR> First offense: Warning.
      <BR>Second offense: Frozen for permanently or temporarily based on the
      decision of the Mortal Affairs Department.
      <BR>These punishments are merely guidelines and might be different depending
      on the severity of the problem. You are all capable of using common sense.
      If you don't know, ask an immortal. Urgent business can be mailed to any admin
      or imp.
