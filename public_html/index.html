<p>Ashes to Ashes is a MUD or a text based adventure / role playing game.
<br>You can play Ashes to Ashes by telneting to <a href="telnet://mud.digital-genesis.com:3333">mud.digital-genesis.com
port 3333</a>
<p>Ashes to Ashes features 9 character classes:
<br>Warriors - Strong (but not too bright), they do a lot of damage in
battle
<br>Paladins - Subclass of good Warriors (though not as fierce fighters),
balanced with some Cleric abilities
<br>Anti-Paladins - Subclass of evil Warriors (though not as fierce fighters),
balanced with some Magic User abilities
<br>Rangers - Subclass of Warriors, excellent trackers / woodsmen and woodswomen
<br>Monks - Adventures with unique ability to defend themselves in combat
<br>Thieves - Adventurers with special talents
<br>Clerics - Adventurers with little to no fighting skills, but heal (and
many other spells) those in fights
<br>Magic Users - Adventures with little to no fighting skills, typically
weak, but cast devastating spells
<br>Psionicist - Strong telepaths that can do many unique things with their
minds
<p>Ashes to Ashes features equipment galore for those who seek their fortune:
<br>The equipment you find at first, is not near as good as the equipment
you will earn in a Quest as you adventure at Ashes to Ashes.
<p>Special Features you will find at Ashes to Ashes: (beyond normal shops)
<br>- A shop with a person that can repair items damaged in fights
<br>- A shop with a person who can remove invisibility from objects adventurers
keep losing because they forget about the invisible items.
<br>- A shop that sells Quest Equipment! Yes it is no easy task to achieve,
but fun to window shop while you continue in Quests to earn the points
needed.
<br>Thank You Sarnoth for the added Shop Keepers !!!!!!!
