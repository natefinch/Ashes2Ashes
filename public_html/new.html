      help ....</FONT></B></P>
    
    <P>Above all else, ready the <A HREF="policy.html" TARGET="">Policy</A>
      and understand it</P>
    
    <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Connecting to the MUD:</FONT><BR>You need a
      program to connect to the Server the MUD is running on through the
      Internet</P>
    
    <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">MUD Terms:</FONT><BR>MOB - short for MOBILE,
      these are the creatures you are seeking to destroy<BR>EQ - short for
      EQUIPMENT<BR>TIN TIN/ZMUD - specialized MUD clients to connect to the
      server, they allow for color and autoactions</P>
    
    <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">MOB Attributes:</FONT> Why did my character die:<BR>MOBs
      have many attributes, much like your character does. Nothing is more
      frustrating than to die from something you did not even see.<BR>AGGRESSIVE
      - some mobs will attack you as you enter a room (or perhaps standing in
      it), for no other reason other than you are there. There is also AGG_GOOD,
      AGG_EVIL and AGG_NEUTRAL where these MOBS will attack you if you are of
      this alignment<BR>HIDDEN - You the character will not see the MOB by
      normal means, coupled with the AGGRESSIVE flag, this can be devastating for
      a new player<BR>INVISIBLE - You the character will not see the MOB by
      normal means and is different from HIDDEN, but can have the same results<BR>MEMORY
      - Some MOBS will remember that you attacked them and will defend
      themselves immediately against you until you have killed it or it has
      killed you. It can be the case where you have attacked a MOB and escaped.
      You later die, but not at that MOBs hands, so it will still try to kill
      you if it encounters you again. This of course will discontinue if the
      game resets<BR>LOOT - These MOBs will pick up items it finds on the
      ground (perhaps it killed you?). If you did not kill the MOB with all of
      your eq on, imagine trying with less of your eq.<BR>Special Processes -
      Through coding MOBS can do a number of devastating things like inflict
      damage on particular classes or persons fighting it. Most anything can
      happen, do not be too surprised. This is generally on the tougher MOBs in
      the game.</P>
    
    <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Player Attributes:</FONT><BR>Strength - how
      strong your character is<BR>Intelligence - how smart your character is<BR>Wisdom
      - how well your character uses his intelligence<BR>Dexterity - how well
      your character moves<BR>Constitution - the stamina your character has<BR>Charisma
      - How &quot;good looking&quot; your character is, or the natural ability
      your character has for persons to admire them<BR>Level - What level your
      character is<BR>Alignment - If you kill evil things, in general you are
      good and vice versa.<BR>Size - how tall your character is<BR>Weight -
      how much your character weighs</P>
    
    <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Item Attributes:</FONT><BR>Items modify your
      character when you use them. It is specific for each item in the game. You
      may need to identify things before using them</P>
    
    <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">General Tips:<BR></FONT>Carry a scroll of recall
      with you at all times! This may get you out of fights or help you if you
      are lost<BR>Stick to Newbie areas at first until you get used to how
      your character will work<BR>Do not be afraid to ask for help, in general
      most people will help you<BR>Do not continuously ask people for help, do
      some exploring on your own<BR>Before you attack a MOB, type &quot;con
      MOB_NAME&quot;, it will give you an estimation of what may happen if you
      are completely healthy<BR>Remember it is only a game, play to have fun</P>
